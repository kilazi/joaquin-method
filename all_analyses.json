      "translation": "Okay, let's look at a very important topic. Without understanding what we're going to do today, it is impossible, one, to understand the methodology, this methodology, and worst of all, not to understand fractality. Therefore, this is one of the most important concepts. And if you don't master it, we're screwed. It will be impossible to master the methodology. Impossible. Let's see, I'm going to draw here, imagine this is a point of control of a downtrend and here we have its corresponding cycle. I'll also do it with an uptrend movement so you can see that the concept is exactly the same. Imagine this is a point of control, here we have a movement, we have its corresponding retracement, the concept is the same, in both cases as we have a retracement to 38%, we can logically mark their corresponding zones. Let's look at the high zone, low zone, we mark their corresponding arrows. Always sell in high zones, in this downtrend case, 61 downwards, and in this uptrend case, 61 upwards and always buy in the low zones. In any of these cases, all cycles have their break level. In this case, I'll mark it here. I'll take off the fibo now. This is the situation of any cycle from any point of control or even the first cycle of any map. This is the usual structure of any activated cycle. Notice I'm marking the high and low zones in different colors because they are the most important zones for you to understand fractality. That is to say, cycles, or rather fractality, is constantly evolving. The movement does not stop. Therefore, the cycle you have marked right now with each corresponding zone is sure, absolutely sure, that it either breaks or evolves. All the fractals that give you a cycle, all either break or evolve. So we have to understand the breakages well. It's clear that this cycle on the left will break once it has already touched the 38.2 here, once it is activated here. The break is clear because we have its break point perfectly delimited. That's why we mark it in all cycles. Either up or down. Either up or down. Do we understand what we're saying about the break point? Yes. If this price gets here, that cycle is broken or if that price at any moment reaches here, the cycle is broken. If the price gets here, the cycle is broken. If the cycle gets here, the cycle is broken. That is to say, that cycle is worthless. It died, it's over, it broke, and it will never be of use again. Therefore, the concept of breakage is very simple. It's not mystical. The problem comes with evolution. Constant evolution. For that, I want you to always understand that when you have marked a cycle, the measures of the zones of that cycle are given because at some point you measured its impulse. At some point, in this uptrend cycle from that point of control, what you did was measure its impulse to which you waited for its corresponding retracement. Do you agree? Yes. Therefore, what marks the category, let's say, of the cycle is the measure of the impulse. When I say category, I mean if it's bigger or smaller. In the end, what you've measured is from a point of control or from the beginning of a map you have measured an impulse. That's what gives you later that the zones are bigger or smaller. Therefore, you are working with that impulse. That's why we measure it. Simply the retracement is the essential condition for us to define that indeed when there is a retracement of that impulse to 38.2, that's the moment we can mark all its zones. Why do I mark the high and low zones differently? And why don't I take into account the zones of 61? Very easy. If you realize this retracement, the height of that retracement to 38.2 is much smaller than the height you're measuring of the impulse. Therefore, when this movement comes to work 61.8, when this movement comes to work 61.8 within the same cycle, the retracement is still smaller than the impulse. Therefore, there's no problem with that retracement exceeding the impulse measurement distance you had. That's why 61.8 doesn't affect the cycle. We can work it absolutely but it doesn't affect any evolution. Because the evolutions you have to understand the ones that occur. It produces a movement greater than the impulse you are working with. What is the first way to make a retracement of the impulse you are working with that is higher than the impulse itself? Well, the first thing is always when the 61 zone breaks the price crosses it and enters the high part. Or in this case, when the price penetrates the 61 zone and in this case reaches the low part. Here we already have a problem, and it's that the retracement is already bigger than the impulse you were working with. Very important. And what we want when we work with fractality is to always work with the larger fractals. That's why the smaller fractals will lead to larger fractals, and why they are breaking, they are becoming obsolete. If we are working in this case, I insist, the breakage of the 61 zone, in this case the high part, or the breakage of the 61 zone, in this case the low part, it is exactly the same, the same situation simply reversed, we already have this first reason to think that, beware, that the impulse with which I was working is no longer the current largest movement within this cycle. When reaching this case, this specific case, only two things can happen. Only two things can happen. Of course, I need you to understand that when this happens either the cycle is broken, that is, either this happens or this happens, first of all things that can happen. That is, if we are in a high zone or a low zone, in this case buys, in this case sells, that the price does not pay attention at all to the direction of the zone we are working and breaks. First of the options. The other option is that the price reaches 61.8 or does not reach 61.8, I don't care, at some point the price works the low zone. Or in this case, the price works the high zone. Here we have a similar problem. That is, in this case, what is happening is that from that point of control or from this point of control, now the movement being made is greater than the movement you were working with. It is superior to the impulse you were working with. And this is another problem. Look at the blue, the height it has, but now we have a greater impulse. In both cases, just like before, now it may happen that the price ends up breaking the zone too. There is no problem. Broken cycle. That the price ends up breaking. No problem at all. What I need you to understand is high and low zone, we have the risk of breakage, yes, but it also implies the danger of cycle evolution. How is cycle evolution produced? It always occurs when, let's first make the case of above, in this case the below case, we already know that the impulse is greater than the impulse, meaning the retracement has become a movement greater than the impulse we were working with. Good. If now this price, we already know that if it doesn't break, but now, if this price works the zone well where it is, that is, if this price now falls, which is what the zone demands, if this price now rises, if this happens, I have to be very aware that if this new impulse superior to the previous one makes us a retracement to 38 at some point, if it makes us a retracement at some point, this zone would no longer be there, it had broken upon reaching there, this zone would not be there, are you following me? If this new impulse at some point, due to the zone working well, makes a retracement there to 38.2, immediately, from that very moment, the previous cycle is obsolete, and we would have a new cycle with its corresponding new zones. Even the point of control would no longer serve any purpose. Everything belonging to the previous cycle, the blue, would be completely dead. And here we would mark the corresponding measurements of the three zones to the new cycle. There has been an important, important evolution. The smaller fractality is breaking because larger fractals are being formed. I don't want to be left with a smaller fractal. I want to work the zones of the larger fractal and that's why I always have to be controlling the evolutions that it does for me. The same would happen in the opposite case. If this price, instead of going for the high zone or this price, instead of going for the low zone, let's put back the 61 zone, goes to the other side, we have exactly the same problem, identical problem, identical problem. We are running the risk of having an evolution. If this zone works well and the price goes up, from the same point of control, from the same point of control, if now this price works well and makes a downward movement, if this price works well and makes an upward movement, we must always be aware at which moment the evolution occurs, at which moment, from the same point of control, at which moment the price makes that retracement, this retracement, because from that very moment the previous cycle is completely broken and we would have to mark new zones, with new measures. This is constant, constant in the charts, and if I don't evolve well with these characteristics, I'm screwed, because I will be working with fractals that no longer serve, zones that are already dead, cycles that are either broken or evolved. This cannot happen. What I want you to understand very well, now we will see an example, this is a priority, understanding this. If I don't understand this, I'm screwed. I will never understand fractality. Let's say it's the most, not that it's complex, it's getting the technique, and I assure you that everyone controls well high and low parts, but it's training it and seeing it on the charts. What are the basic behaviors you must have every time you have a cycle? Just like that. I don't know what this price is going to do, I don't know if it's going to go to a high part if it's going to go to a low part, I don't know what it's going to do. What I do know is where it breaks, that's for sure. What you have to understand then is that this cycle you have here right now, one of the things that can happen, if this comes, if it's a downcycle, means the movement is downwards. If here you have an upcycle, it's clear that it's an upwards movement. Well, one of the things that can happen is it goes boom boom boom boom, breaks, doesn't even give you work reasons, breaks directly, and that cycle goes to hell. You will already have to be watching the new control points that can be going on in the rise. Another thing that can happen is everything goes to hell and breaks down. That nothing works. Or you can even see the situation that the 61 zone works well and the price continues in the same direction. Well, we break the cycle, we control the new control points, we see it is superior to the previous one, this one is dead, and we would move to the next point which is higher. This is the first thing that can happen. That they break, well, they're going to break a lot. What I need you to understand is the following. The basic, fundamental, elementary rule, the first brand concept you have to have very clear once you have the cycle marked just as I have it here is the following. If at any moment, logically we would have marked level 38 here. Here we would have marked level 38. Okay, full horizontal line. Okay, perfect. Elementary, basic behavior, always the same. If at any moment the price enters a high zone, this 61 zone is obvious it doesn't matter, that 38 is obvious it doesn't matter and this bottom zone is obvious it doesn't matter either. Because once you arrive up here, you either break or evolve. You either break or evolve. Therefore, this 61 mark, its 38 and its opposite zone are of no use at all. Just as if it does this, if at any moment the price works the lower part, the 38 level, the 61 zone and its opposite zone are also worth nothing because you either break or evolve. First thing, eliminate the other cycle marks. Immediately if this happens, off goes the 38, off goes 61, off goes the upper zone and of course the breakage of the upper zone. Only this zone would serve me because either it pulls up and evolves or breaks. I stay with this mark and this mark. The same would happen here, if the price here enters a high zone, this 38, that zone, and the low zone are of no use to me because either break or evolve. I already have no value for this mark or this or this. Opposite case, if you come down, logically the 61 zone would already be broken but neither the 38 nor the opposite zone nor its break serves me. You either break down or shoot and evolve. Concept, it is essential that you do, remove the marks that no longer matter and remember, if the price enters a high zone or enters a low zone, I don't care if the cycle is bullish or bearish, the other zones and the 38 of that cycle are immediately out.",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "This concept of evolutions and cycle breaks, let's see it on a chart. I insist that this applies to all timeframes, so it doesn't matter which one you're on. The concept is the same, fractality can be found in a minute chart or a daily chart and is worked the same way. Notice something very important, when you work with any system, any price behavior you want to verify, when you try to work or consult patterns or structures, whatever, when you try to see things on the chart, I always say you have three ways to do it. One is with a past, completed, global chart. Past, completed, global chart. What does this mean? It's exactly what you have here. I have a chart in whichever timeframe and I can clearly see what the price did. I see the price has done all of this and all of this and all of this. Past, completed chart. The first way I would have to verify that behavior, that pattern, that structure, the first way to do it. The second way to do it is what I call a past, reviewed chart. Past, reviewed chart. It means that this global movement I have here, completed, now I will see its nuances. I review the nuances that occurred to make this great movement. What does it mean to see the nuances? Well, to see how this entire global movement was constructed, which I saw completely before. I'll see everything that happened. In other words for us, internal fractality. First I was seeing, let's say, a global fractal and the second way is to understand that to form that global fractal, internal fractality formed first. I repeat, past, reviewed chart. Observe the nuances. And lastly, the third way we have to verify those kinds of behaviors, patterns, fractality, whatever, is with what I call a moving chart. That is, it is the day-to-day. Let's say it’s the daily evolution of the price where you are watching live how that structure, that pattern, that fractal, whatever it is, is forming. So we have three ways to verify behavior. For me, without a doubt, the most important is the past, reviewed chart. It is what can help you the most so that later, in the moving chart, you do it better. We are going to do an exercise and this is an exercise I recommend and have done thousands of times to verify things. We’re going to do it using the past, reviewed chart. Let's see the nuances because that way you’ll have a better view of this concept of fractality that we're seeing today. Let's take this movement, all this movement, and go through it. I'll make it bigger so you can see it. Okay, look. We see it much better this way. We’re going to go through what happened here and try to see what we just explained about evolutions or cycle breaks. Note, we understand that here we have the first movement where we would have the first fractal. Agree? I would do this. I see there's no cycle. The price keeps moving up. I'm going with it from below. Let’s say we now have this. We see that the price didn’t activate a cycle, but it went up. Therefore, we would have this. There we have the first cycle. We would start marking the first zones. Perfect. I'm observing. Remember that here what we are doing now is not about entries or viewing these things. We are trying to understand a concept of fractality with what we explained about breaks and evolutions. Here we can see that, well, it worked the 61 zone. Good, perfect. Doesn't matter to us. And the price, boom, breaks. Breaks the high zone, breaks. Perfect. If we have this clear and know how we work this, here we would find our first point of control. Perfect. I could then be working from the start and from the control point. Therefore, on my map, I would have to be doing this. That, on one hand, I see there are no cycles yet. From here, no cycles still. This is what you'll get later in motion. Note how here the next point is the next maximum. Here we would have the next control point. Perfect. We see it’s a validated control point and, therefore, this is a new control point. Notice how, from here, our map would already be doing this kind of thing. Well, it’s already validated here. The price would be like this. We would be doing this. We would also be doing this. Here, we would have the 38 of the cycle from below and from the control point. And also, I won't mark it because it’s unnecessary. It's clear that it didn’t activate anything, but we would already be working with these last points. Notice how the price here. I could be marking its high zone, its 61 zone, and its low zone. Well, I worked the 61 zone well and the price broke. Perfect. Cycle broken. OK. We evolve with the chart. Here what happened is that a new control point larger than the previous one was produced. Therefore, we would be working this movement. That would be the real movement we have so far. I can already be working. It's a smaller retracement than the last. So everything is correct. This is what we'll get later. That's why these nuances are very important to train this way. Very important. This exercise is very important. If we continue doing all of this, I could now be looking for a cycle from the top, because this comes to us here. I could be looking from here or could be looking from here. Let's see what happens. I am doing this. Notice how it’s not giving us a cycle, not giving a cycle, but a new point gets validated. I couldn’t be working anything here, but a new point is validated up there. Are we agreed up to here? Okay. Notice then how, as long as the price doesn't make major retracements, I won't be able to activate these first points, all of which are correct, even from the beginning. I am working with the points I have here. I'll make it larger so you can see it. Notice what we talked about evolution. Notice how here the case is that the price breaks the cycle. Here we would have the bottom zone. Breaks the cycle. Perfect. From the moment the price touched here, this control point is not valid. And if you realize, it came to work the 61 zone of the previous one. Do you follow how we must evolve? Okay. Perfect. The true movement now of the chart would be this. Logically here we would have its high and low parts. Either evolve or break. There’s nothing else. We are observing it. It breaks it. Perfect. What happened here? Well, a cycle break occurred. It’s not worth anything. The market cannot behave otherwise. We go to a new control point. This is what you should be monitoring. Larger than the previous. Larger than the previous. Broken point. Point that is not worth. We eliminate. We are left with far fewer work points. We have a very correct control point here. What should I be doing now? Well, I can work with complete movement. There I would have its 38. Or I can work with this. Are you following me? Yes. Okay. Perfect. Let's observe what happens. Notice what happens. What happens is here, logically, the price gives no cycle in any of the cases. What it leaves us with is a new control point. It’s validated. We continue. Correct control point. I would have my first 38 from this one. I would have it close by here. Notice how here it gives another control point. There you would have another control point. Here we would have the 38 from the previous one. And here we would have the 38 from this one. Notice how this point breaks. The price falls below, it breaks. We would have this situation. Notice how it activates the cycle. At least we have this area here. We have this area here. And we have this area here. With its corresponding level of break both up and down. And we could mark, if you want, the full 38 level that is here. This is what you will face live. That's why this revised part with nuances is much more interesting. Not saying the past chart should not be mastered well. But in terms of training, much better. Much better. Because you're more prepared for the real daily movement. Much better. Let's see what happens. Notice what happens. This last cycle breaks. Here it broke. Therefore this cycle is dead. Either breaks or evolves. Notice how the activation of a new zone of a higher cycle is intertwined. Minor cycles always give way to larger cycles. Cannot be otherwise. We could even be trying to work the activation of this. Notice how here. Let's mark the lower zone from here. Let's see if it activates this. Therefore, notice how we already have activated the big zone. I work from the start. I work from the control point that remains valid. 61 zone that either goes low or goes up. Let's see what it does. It works low and boom! I immediately remove the rest of the marks from this cycle. It works a low zone. I must be very aware of evolution. That is, if currently the price of this movement gives me a retracement to 38 and there I have it, that control point and this zone automatically disappear. Out. Evolution. This point already did its job. It never serves again. And now we would have the zone here of the total. We would have the 61.8 zone of this small one and we would have the high zone of the total.",

      "translation": "I also wanted to talk to you about another important topic, at least it is for me, which is a misunderstood concept among new traders - the concept of winning and losing trades. I understand that when people come from other educations or have been self-taught, their idea of winning and losing does not match mine. I need you to understand very well my concept of loss and victory. Basically, if we're talking about losing trades, I have what I call complete losers. These are trades where I enter the market here, maybe buy here, set a stop, and place my targets wherever, but I don't have time to do anything before the price goes straight to my stop. A complete losing trade is managed with an amount I have established as the maximum loss in my business plan – as simple as that. I also use a concept called a null losing trade. Imagine I use a risk, and I'm making this up, that my business plan says I have a risk of $50 and my winning trade should make $300. If I lose the complete trade, I lose $50, but to consider a trade a winner, with or without partials, I must make $300. Now, what is a null trade? We've seen that a complete losing trade ends with minus $50, but for a null trade, if the price quickly moves against me and I see it has no inclination to move in my favor, I generally don't keep such trades. So, that trade, which perhaps ends with me exiting, costs me $25 – an amount less than my business plan maximum. Hence, it's not a complete loser. When we discuss winning trades, a complete winner aligns with my business plan: I have made €300, whether through partial, double partial, triple partials – I don't care. The total of all partials and the final must equal $300 to be a complete winner. I also have what I call positive trades – not a winning trade. What is a positive trade? Any trade where the price allows for a partial. For example, I enter here, and my targets are above to make 300, but I might have several partials. A positive trade reaches an initial partial but then takes me out. So instead of making €300, I might make €40 because the price allowed only for a partial before stopping me at break-even. So, it’s not a winning trade, it’s a positive one. These positive trades will never grow my account; they are used to recover a complete losing or a null trade. Finally, there's what I call very winning trades; this is when I let something run beyond €300 and it might reach €500. This is a very winning trade. These are typical trades that suddenly boost your account significantly. I'm aware of five outcome options. My trading isn't about stop-profit. It's much more nuanced. A lot of usage of partials, reduction of loss. Positive trades won't grow your account, so they aren't counted. So, it's more complex. Entering the market like a gamble – hitting a stop or profit without management, doesn't make sense to me. If we're using an extensive ratio, incorporating partial tools, we must acknowledge five aspects when evaluating trade results, heavily relying on management style. Let’s see it in a specific example. Look, this trade from last month has given the necessary partials and final target. By reaching here with its partials and final, it was already a winner. But I always leave a trade to try for a very winning trade. Look at where the price is now. This is a very winning trade, the kind that suddenly boosts your account. When a very winning trade far exceeds your business plan targets, you need to eventually close it. Even with my experience in long-term ratios for trade durations, there’s a point you just don’t want more. We’ll close this trade today and keep the position running from the other day, which I’ll now explain. This other trade, this would be the very winning one. Any losing trades were saved before hitting the stop, no mystery there. For example, this trade comes with several fractional positions. You get a first target here, a second here, by now it’s a winner, fulfilling the €300 target from our earlier example. But I leave one to try for a very winning trade – an extra, a cherry on top, a gift. In short positions, you might get a partial or two, but not reach targets, it’s a null trade. Very winning, winning, null. It doesn’t matter if I make a bit here or there if it doesn’t meet the €300. Therefore, I like this graph as it shows different ways I assess trade outcomes based on my business plan.",

      "translation": "Let me see if I can explain myself. When you are profitable, when you achieve profitability, and when I talk about profitability, I'm not referring to an exact amount, when you have, I don't know, one, two, three years of being profitable, we know the word profitable is very, very subjective because we're not talking about an exact amount. When you reach this point, you are profitable for different reasons. You've reached that level for various reasons, without a doubt, the first is because you've found the right discipline. I cannot conceive that a person is profitable unless, first of all, regardless of the method used, they have developed discipline. That also means that if you are profitable, you have found the appropriate numbers for you, undoubtedly. If you haven't found the right numbers for yourself, you will never be profitable. Therefore, discipline and numbers, that discipline and those numbers will be applied to a method that you have found and that suits you. Yes, you will have also found assets, a type of asset that fits your discipline, your numbers, and the method. Not all assets behave the same, and without a doubt, you've managed to adjust all operations that these four previous factors demand to your personal condition. Each of you has a different personal condition, a different availability, a different history. It's very important that these five factors, which summarize what I consider, without them, if one fails, you wouldn't be successful. Therefore, you have managed to create a correct mixture of these five factors that led you to profitability. Notice that we already have a cocktail of five factors that is complex, it's already complex to mix them correctly. The dish has to be very well made with the right touch of each one. But notice, there are two of these factors that can throw everything away. The first of them is the assets. That is, when we have that mixture and we think that with the same discipline, with the same numbers, with the same method, the assets will always behave the same way, we start to encounter problems. I can understand that these first three factors, that discipline, those numbers, and that method, will always remain the same, to that extent I agree. But what happens when you realize that the assets you work on do not behave the same? You realize that in that year, two years, three years you've been profitable applying your method to those assets, you start to realize that the assets move differently, things happen. Here we have the first unknown of what will happen to your profitability if this occurs. Normally we practice with very different assets, but in the end, I assure you that the person who is profitable means that they have spent time with the methodology they use and already figured out which assets best suit their methodology and their own condition, this is certain. Any operator eventually ends up making their own selection of a greater or lesser number of assets that are not only better understood but also confirmed that their way of operating fits better. If those assets begin to behave differently, it's the first possible cause where your profitability could be affected. Besides, the other option where your methodology could be totally affected is when your personal conditions change. What does a personal condition mean? It's easy, imagine that during those, I don't know, two years that you have been working well and been profitable to a greater or lesser extent, imagine that you had four hours available to do your trading, four available hours every day, four hours available in a row. Your discipline, your numbers, your method, and your assets in those four consecutive hours allowed you to do profitable trading. Now suppose for whatever reason you can now only do two hours, stop for another two hours because you can't be there for four straight hours, and then return for another two hours. That is, you continue working four hours in your trading, yes, but it's not the same. You had four consecutive hours that perfectly adapted to the asset, the method, the numbers, and the discipline at the schedule you wanted or at the times you wanted. The moment you change to working two, stopping two, and returning two, as you can understand, your trading cannot be the same, it's not possible. Did the method change? No. Did the assets change? No. Did your numbers change? No. Did your discipline change? No. But your trading is different, without a doubt. Not to mention when now instead of having your four available hours, you have 30 minutes now, then you have to stop another 30 minutes, the next 30 minutes you can't, then you return another 30 minutes later, then an hour later you can't, and you return another hour later. This changes everything. When I say everything, I mean everything. How is it possible that applying the same method that made me profitable two years, applying the same numbers, applying the same discipline, and in the same assets, now isn't profitable anymore? It's very simple, because your personal condition is not the same. So notice how a variable personal condition, for whatever reason, can change everything. So what happens? Imagine if besides the personal condition the assets change too. If both factors come together, you have a huge problem. You have a problem of having to adapt everything again, all that time it took you to acquire the discipline, get the numbers, the method, choose the assets, and with that personal condition, it's no longer valid, absolutely no longer valid. Does it mean the method is no longer useful? No, we're not saying the method isn't useful. What we're saying is you can't apply the method in the same way, you can't. Therefore, what will you have to do? You will have to adapt the method to the new conditions, there's no other choice. What happens then? You start again, not from scratch because you already have the discipline. But surely you will have to modify numbers, maybe the entry methods you had in that method, you have to modify them, and maybe you shouldn't work in the same assets because if your personal conditions do not allow you to properly follow through, you will have to modify even possibly the assets. So where am I going with this? I always use the same example, real life. Do not take for granted that because you and your family are well today, you will always be well. Things that alter this will happen, without a doubt, that's life law, things that alter that state, and you will have no choice but to adapt. Well, trading is the same. So what happens? Damn, with what it took me to be with my family in this situation and two years going great without any problem, suddenly for whatever reason, we start seeing things that alter that situation. When we transfer this to trading, what I'm trying to warn you about is that this is one of the parts, just like life itself, very complex, the adaptation to this kind of inconvenience. So never take for granted that when you have a methodology and a winning condition, never take for granted that this will always be so. This is the most complex part of trading, even, in my opinion, it's easier to find the discipline, the numbers, the method, the assets from the start. It's easier, mind you, with all its complexity. The problem arises when you believe you have it, but external performances tell you no, that yes you had it, but it's no longer valid. Depending on the capacity you have to adapt to the new condition, will be your possible future. Past years' results don't imply future years' results, that adaptation you'll have to do when this occurs will take time, that is, it's like a new renewal of, dammit, I have to start adapting all parameters again and that time we don't know how long it is, but if we want to continue in the fight, in the league, in the mud, if we want to keep trading, we're going to have to do it. That's why trading never ends.",

      "translation": "So could we say that we have a first fractal here in this drawing? Okay, there's no doubt. Now what I need you to understand, I insist this is something I'm teaching you today is basic trading. I need you to understand that here a retracement is happening, right? Yes. I need you to understand something vital. The duration of retracements. A retracement can be measured in two ways. By duration, time and height or measure. What is time? Very simple. When does a retracement end? We've already seen where a retracement forms. But now, how can I say that the retracement is over? Imagine this retracement now does this. Could I say that this retracement is over? No. Because for the retracement to be over, in order to know that the new impulse of the next fractal is taking place, as I always tell you, the rules are objective. There is no possible interpretation here. To know that the impulse of the next fractal is indeed happening, I need it to meet an objective requirement. That is that the retracement that has occurred, I will measure it with my Fibonacci. The retracement. As long as that price, which is now up there, does not touch our Fibonacci level 130, I cannot consider the retracement concluded. Because what we ask is that it falls below the start of the retracement by a third of its measure. Do we agree? In other words, look at where this retracement is. Here it made a minimum. Okay, we know there is a retracement. Right now the retracement has become deeper and now it has that height. As long as the price doesn’t do this and touch the 130, I cannot say that the retracement has concluded. If the price made that high there and is like this, can I say the retracement is over? No. Moreover, this retracement can continue to rise. Therefore, I'll take my Fibo and measure it again completely. From where the retracement started, I keep measuring with my Fibo. And notice how the 130 changes place. The deeper the retracement becomes, the more the 130 is left behind. I don’t know when this retracement will end. I only know that as long as it doesn’t touch here, I don’t consider it concluded. If the price does this, can I say the retracement is over? No. Absolutely not. If the price does this, can I consider it over? No, absolutely not. If the price does this, can I consider it over? No, neither. Absolutely not. The condition is essential. Either you touch it or I do not consider the retracement finished. Because now the price can do this. The retracement is not over. Even the price can do this. The retracement is not over. Earlier I told you, retracements can be measured in two ways. By time and by height or measurement. Why is this so important? Because retracements, if you are realizing, can last a long time. The price can be in this state for a long time, as long as it wants until it touches the 130. What I want you to understand is that in this process the price can take as long as it wants. It can do this, it can do this, it can do this. Has it touched the 130? No, not at all. Exactly. Well, this type of retracements, and listen well to what I say, because this is what confuses all novice traders, there are two types of retracements when it comes to time. I will give you here the same impulse as before. I will put the same retracement. Notice that I will take the same height of the retracement we were making here. This would be its retracement. I would measure the retracement with my fibo. Same situation, right? Okay, there is the retracement we call fast and there is the retracement we call slow. There are retracements that go directly to 130 and take very little time. This is what we call fast retracements. They make the retracement at whatever height, but quickly generate the new impulse to form the next fractal. But I’ll tell you one thing, fast retracements are very easy to see. Any novice trader sees fast retracements well on a chart. But you need to understand, charts are always manipulated. You are in this business with your little account, someone allows you to participate in this business, someone allows you to start investing from a broker without having any idea, what happens? Well, today anyone can open an account with 50 euros and they don’t ask you to know anything. That is, here they do not do any kind of exam, they do not require you to have half a million euros in your bank account, they ask for nothing. You have to know where you are getting into. You are entering a jungle where you are allowed to enter, you and many others, me for example, you are allowed in with one single intention. What is it? To take your money. Exactly, because if they allowed retail, as it is called, ordinary people to put their money in here it’s because they’re sure of one thing. First, you are all going to leave your money here and second, the charts you work with are managed by them. You put liquidity into the market and the same people always take it. This is not the best business in the world as people believe. No, no, no, no. You are here or they allow you to be here because there are millions of people like you who leave their money here. When we talk about charts, and now I delve into the chart which is what we are seeing now, in this of slow retracements and fast retracements, which is the first example I give you of what you will find, I need you to understand that the charts will not be clean charts, they will not be charts with fast retracements, that clearly show the retracement, a linear retracement that you measure, a retracement without any kind of lines straight, no. They want your money and a very simple way to take your money is that when you see the chart with your system, with your analysis, with the way you have decided to look at the charts, the more confusing it is, the easier you lose it. Forget about this being easy. No, it’s not easy, if it were, they wouldn’t have let you in. If it were easy, they wouldn’t have let you in. What I mean by this is that if we are saying that markets are impulse, retracement, impulse, retracement, impulse, retracement, they will be impulses and retracements with the intention to confuse you as much as possible. Most of the retracements you will find are not fast, they are not pretty, they are not clean to see, they are not easy to analyze, they are not easy to... I hope I make myself understood. Most retracements will be like this, slow, because people here no longer know what they are seeing. Imagine this retracement that started here and now look at what this damn retracement is. Now it comes back here and drops here and now suddenly it goes back up here again and now suddenly it goes back down here. This is still a retracement, what happens is that it is stretched out over time. It is a slow retracement. Has it touched the 130? No, the retracement is not over.",

      "translation": "This type of trading, where I go for very long targets, has a lot of errors. I say this because of the partials issue. And it's very dangerous. Why? Because it's true that when I catch one of these, not only do I recover the mistakes I've made, but I make money. What happens? That when you have a streak where you don't get these, you don't get this winner, in the end what happens is that your account survives based on the partial you got. It certainly won't cause you a huge loss. But keep in mind that while the winner doesn't arrive, I want you to understand something, I'm going to have a huge streak of losers. And when I say losers, I mean break-evens. Whether I take partials earlier or later, this kind of big exit, it's like those partials just help you to maintain the account until your winning streak arrives. Because even though you see that they are very long ratios, there are also winning streaks. The moment you start getting 2, 3, 4, 5 moves, the account goes up a lot. And it compensates you a lot for all that time you have been surviving on partials. I don't look for huge partials. Notice how, for example, I might go to seek this target and my first and only partial is here, in this 61 area with that blue. And notice that I don't take more. Someone might say, heck, you take one there, you take another one here. I don't know, you take another one here. I don't know, you take another one here. No. No, because that unbalances my statistics. Why? Because in the end, yes, you take a very long ride, but since you have been releasing, releasing, releasing, in the end, those 700 pips are not 700 pips. Yes, the final position reaches 700 pips, but the amount of money you have made there with so many partials doesn't give me statistically to compensate for the error. That's why I'm not taking partials, taking partials, taking. Mind you, I'm not saying it's wrong. Normally, the issue of partials, everyone interprets it their way. I simply interpret mine. If someone tells me, well look, I prefer, I am much more conservative than you, here I take partial, here I take partial, here I take partial, here I take partial. In other words, as the price gives me reason, I'm taking, taking, taking. And that's totally correct. But it will depend a lot on your type of statistics. Because in the end, this journey of I don't know how many pips here, you will have gotten what you took here, what you took here, what you took here, here, here. And in the end, it will have given you some money. Because in the end, here, never forget that behind everything you do here are numbers. I'm not saying it's better to apply some numbers than others when it comes to making money. I'm not saying that. But logically, in this movement, you and I, for example, someone who has done partial, partial, partial, partial, partial, partial and in the end, the price actually reached here. That person, compared to me, where in the same movement I only took one partial here and did not take anything for the rest of the movement, well, it is obvious that if you stop to think about it, it's safer, so to speak. It's more reassuring, so to speak. Because in the end, imagine that the price goes from here to both you and me, it's the same movement, you will have taken 1, 2, 3. You in that operation that in the end does this, earn more than I do because I only took one partial. And in the end, my stops will have been triggered, your stops will have been triggered, but since I took one partial and you three, you earn more than I do. Then we have to evaluate what numbers we use, what numbers we have, what error we have, how we add, how we lose. There is no better way. Many ask me about how to use partials. And I always say, if you are a person who does not tolerate that many times you take that partial there and look at the amount of journey you have here, since you take the partial until the end target, look at the amount of journey you have there. Once you and I have taken the same partial in the same place and even though we have the same potential target, let's assume it, imagine it, which is this level, this person is predetermined because they will take different partials. And I say, I don't take more. What happens? That I risk in any part of this journey, which in this example I'm making up is 900 bits, it could be 100, 200, depending on the case, I am making this up, it can turn around. It's not just that it can turn around, it's that in the majority of cases it will turn around. I know it. In any of this space, it can turn around and I am left with the partial already screwed over because the other positions will be protected. So, what happens? That most of the time it turns around. I will try that when it turns around to try to catch it with some coverage, but many times I do not catch coverage. Therefore, I will be left watching. Heck, this price went 200 bits in my favor and now screwed over, boom, it turns around. This happens to me endlessly. That's why I say that most times, while I do not catch the good trades, the account is maintained with small partials. So, of course, you have to be worthy of this. This is a very difficult operation in the mental sense, not numerical. It is simple as heck. Heck, I take a partial and hope it reaches my final target. Technically, it is very simple. It's a technique that when it wins, it wins a lot. When you get the good ones, it wins a lot, but until you catch them, you have to have a strong mental fortitude. This is not the best way to do it. Therefore, another person can tell me, look, I'm going to seek the same goals as you in terms of distance, but I can't do this operation. I take partial, take partial, take partial and let it turn around when it wants, but I take partial each step of I don't know how much because I am much calmer in that operation and because my curve of results is more stable. And I tell you, you are absolutely right. The difference between these ways of taking more partials or fewer partials, of taking partials closer or taking partials further away, what differentiates them are two things. First, the numbers. The numbers must match. And two, you have to withstand it. That is why I insist so much that the option of partials, one partial or 2 or 3 or 4, or taking it earlier or taking it later, is something very, very, very personal. There is no better way than another. If now, at this moment, we all worked with partials and each of us used that concept of partial differently, none of the 10 is right. None of the 10 could say, my way is the best. That does not exist, especially for those starting out. Understand that there is a secret or there is a magic formula for the use of the partial. I always told you that the partial is not designed to make money, it is designed for the operator's peace of mind. So, we are talking about a subjective concept, the operator's peace of mind. Then we will have to see what the operator is like because the 10 operators are going to be different. We are not going to achieve the point of tranquility in the same place. Just as I tell you the bad, in this case of my way, the bad is that I can have very long periods where my targets do not arrive. Now, I also tell you that it is the way to make the most money. It is the way to make the most money because unlike this person who is with partials when I see that the position is going well, not only will I not take partials from the sales, but I will be trying to put more positions to the movement. So, notice how this person, for their mental tranquility, intends for this movement to be done perhaps with, I don't know, 2, 3, 4, 5 partials and indeed reaches the end and will have taken out x money with a terrific operational tranquility for him. However, I do not want to take more initial partials, only one, which is the one that protects me, let's say. And in return, if the movement goes in my favor, I want to put in more. That is, I want to go down as loaded as possible. However, this person, as he goes out, reaches down practically with nothing. So, it is neither better nor worse, they are very different operations. What I do want to tell you is, this is a way of working that gives you much more calm, gives the operator much more calm and more stable numbers. That is, there is a mental calm that this operation produces, however, this operation is much more aggressive. And in the drawback that it is much more aggressive and that the movement does not always occur and that many times, most of the time, it turns around. Now, when you take the complete move from above and have been able to incorporate more positions, this operation that has given me all that is as if this person had done 7 or 8 operations of this type. I earn the same as him in 7 or 8. So you can see that there is a good part and a bad part to any way of trading. The secret is not thinking which one is better, but which one suits you best. I never tire of repeating this to you. Do not focus on how I do it. Do not focus on how the other does it. Focus on the concept that Joaquín tells you, there is a concept called partial, there is a very interesting concept to work with called partial, which serves to relieve pressure at certain moments of a trade and tells you that you should try to find the right point not only in the number of partials you use, but in the moment you use them. And forget about what Joaquín does.",

    "title": "Students Preferred Ratios",
    "analysis": {
      "translation": "The question I've been asked, Joaquín, from all the students who at least don't lose or are already winning, could you tell me or do you have any statistics about the profit ratios and post-entry management that are most commonly used? Yes, I do know. Let me explain it. These are ratios that I always tell you that we need to have certain profit-taking strategies and a post-entry management that makes us comfortable. Without a doubt, without that, we won't be able to repeat it. Regardless of what it can generate, if I don't repeat, there's no income. Therefore, the first thing you need to look for in ratios plus post-entry management is that it is repetitive. If you can't repeat it, no ratio or management will serve you. So, when I talk about this, there is a type of ratio and a type of management that is usually comfortable for these people. That is, most tolerate it, work with it, and it gives results. I'm not talking about entries. I'm talking about the type of ratio they use and what they do after entering. What I'm going to tell you, they do with both a single entry and a fractional entry. But I will tell you one thing. The people who work best with a fractional entry do so with two. From three, it becomes confusing. But with a single entry, what I'm going to tell you, they also do it. What is the ratio that I have noticed is most comfortable for people and that, in addition to being able to repeat it well, works for them? Regardless of how they enter. It's the 1 to 4. This 1 to 4, some use it with a single entry. Therefore, there are no partials. And they do the following. They enter the market, place the stop and the lot size that their line of work indicates. X lot size, determined by their business plan and the line they have chosen to decide and with their risk size. Perfect. If they have their 1 to 4 here, without partial, what they do is here are two versions. When the price is at 1 to 1 or others at 1 to 2, they place the stop at half. That ends the management. The second version, with a fractional entry or not, but same story, lot size marked by the line of work, stop set by the line, but with the difference that here at 1 to 1, some and others at 1 to 2, take a partial from half and place the stop at half. But if it's 1 to 1, it goes to 1 to 7 and the one most used is 1 to 2 going to targets of 1 to 6. The 1 to 2 would go with a final at 1 to 6 and the 1 to 1 would go with a final at 1 to 7. They don't set break even. That is, in the end, I always tell you that here there is nothing better. I'm telling you what I notice. There are other people who say, no, I do break even. But I'm simply giving you what I see as more comfortable. Keep in mind that if you take the 1 to 1, or rather, it's at 1 to 1, you don't take a partial. If this operation fails, you lose half. You no longer lose all of it. And also, the 1 to 4, as you go without partial, you only managed part of the stop, there is no partial, it's the closest profit. Therefore, your success rate will be higher than if you do 1 to 6, 1 to 7. These people, let's say, their calmness comes from that at 1 to 1, if they fail, they lose half. And with that, they are calm. Here, the psychological aspect is what rules. The psychological and the repetitive. That you have the guts to repeat it constantly and that psychologically it doesn't affect you. This is one of the methods I see the most. Some do it at 1 to 1, and others only move the stop at 1 to 2. Halfway. And final ratio 1 to 4. Many people do this. The other version, very different. They take partial at 1 to 1, stop at half. If the price turns around, they don't lose anything. At 1 to 2, if you take partial, you place stop here, you still earn something if you're taken out. But in exchange, they are able to hold 1 to 6 or 1 to 7. That is, for them, the comfort is in taking something. For these, they don't mind taking something because they are just calm moving the stop. But these and other people prefer to take something. Knowing that the moment they take, their operation no longer loses. These are different concepts that can be equally good or bad depending on who uses them. So there are some people who feel very comfortable with this and would never take the other. They would never do it. Because in fact, they tried them before choosing this. They tried this and as soon as they experienced this, they said no way. They want the shortest possible ratios set by their business plan. And they prefer management with the stop. And on the contrary, these people when they tried this, they were not comfortable when the price was at 1 to 2. It turned around. They were not comfortable with that. That's why they need to have the feeling of taking something relatively soon. So that if the price doesn't want to go where they have it, at least they are calm. In another way, but calm. It's no coincidence. I notice that these two methods are the most used. And always remember that when we talk about 1 to 4 and these people have 10 risk, they are going to look for 40 target. That is, this person, if the price touches 1 to 4, wins 40. This person, if they take the partial and it touches the final, they win 40. That is, four times what they risk. There are many people who get obsessed with one way of managing or entering. I insist, here we are not talking about the reason for the entry. We are talking about how you manage it and what ratios you seek. I am tired of seeing people obsess with one way of managing their trades without realizing that it doesn't work at all for them. And maybe making a change to another way would work much better for them. People who get into this type of fixed ratio and actually what they need for their way of being is to use partial. There are people who need partial and there are other people who don't need partial. And this has nothing to do with any method. It's called personal management. Then the worst mistake you can make is getting into management or ratios that you can't stand just out of stubbornness. Doing this management, doing this management, the results are radically different. But you can't look for completely different results if you don't realize that it doesn't work for you and that there are 300 million ways to manage a trade. And I always told you, until you find yours because you only have one and maybe you haven't found it yet because you haven't looked hard enough. And you've insisted on others and others and others, and you're losing, losing, losing. This is vital. Don't bang your head against the wall trying to, it's that I want to have this ratio, it's that I.. it's not what you want. The worst, that today you do one management, tomorrow you do another, the day after you do another, the day after tomorrow you do another. These are the most common problems of people who lose. That there are many ways to do it. What is most important is that you realize which one you need and why. And here is one of the keys to the potential results you can achieve. Finding it. Nobody can give it to you. These are just numbers, tests, sensations, tests, sensations and above all repetition, repetition. I have to be able to repeat because if not, none is worth it.",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Let's start by looking at one of the assets you're asking me about the most, the one I'm hearing about the most these days, let's start with gold. Well, firstly, we've been saying for months that gold has been very complicated to work with using our methodology, because of random movements, with very little fractality and very few concepts that help us to be part of such a tremendously bullish move, our method gave us very few opportunities to enter the market, but we also spent many months saying that this upward movement was random, it was a very forced move. What happened here, let's go to a short chart, let's situate ourselves where we were, notice how random the ascent was, you know that a lack of fractality doesn't suit our method, and on top of that, the fractality it was creating was very deficient for us, and we were in this situation, we were with a last point of control that was here, let's situate ourselves on a 15-minute chart to see it better, what I was looking for throughout the climb was for the price to somehow suggest it might eventually experience a strong fall, which was undeniable to happen at some point. The movement I was looking for was a point of control, an impulse movement, where from that point of control, you know, our usual cycle would form at 38, and at some point, there would be a failure of those highs, so they started breaking the lows and from here any 61.8 was already a reason to sell. This was one of the first figures I was waiting for. The other possible figure I was waiting for was the same figure, with the difference that once it gives you the cycle, it would work in the upper zone, the price would do a good job, start breaking lows, and any 61 is already a reason to sell. If there's none of these two figures, it was impossible for the price to fall under our methodology. We were insisting for months that this would cause a strong drop, yes, but the right conditions were not met. Also, when we look at this, these 61.8, if the price made this figure, there would have to be a strong movement. A structure resembling something very similar had to occur. What happened here? What happened here was the following. Notice how the price from that last point of control actually makes the impulse, makes the pullback, gives us the cycle, that red zone wasn't there. So, what was one of the options? Either it was to go seek the upper zone of that mini-cycle, again not that red zone, and from that point start breaking those internal control points. This was a typical condition so that from there it would make some pullback to 61, option one. And the other option is maximum failure. That it makes a maximum failure, start breaking internal control points, and from there any 61.8 is already a reason to sell. That already, without a doubt, had to give us a strong fall movement. Notice what the price did here. The price makes me fail, makes me fail at highs, it complies with the minimum rule which has to be breaking the internal control point, and from that moment any fall to 61.8 is a reason to sell. And once it gives the reason, this is what had to happen. This situation hasn't been happening for months. Notice then how the structure perfectly fits. Indeed, here we initiated short positions. The price plunges, plunges, plunges. It even gave us a new option to enter at 61.8 of continuation and also already breaking control points. Notice how the price even gives us a new work option at 61.8. It did it perfectly. This is exactly the figure. Now I want you to notice the type of moves. Notice how it starts behaving now, now yes. Notice how the candles were, the type of moves. Notice how forced each of these moves was, which we've been talking about for a long time. Completely forced moves that we've been saying for a long time that were going to be collected. And notice how now fractality starts to be as it should be. Notice how each impulse retracement is good, impulse retracement is good. I want you to notice the type of behavior, how it is handled well, how it is handled not, how a correct fractality is effectively drawn and notice how these moves are absolutely made up, absolutely forced. This is very important for you to take into account. Ultimately, you already know that we don't care about the reasons. Any reason that makes a price of any asset fall is shown on the chart. We don't care what the reason is. We don't spend a minute looking for macro reasons. The chart shows it to you. A fall of a thousand dollars. Superb. The price reaches areas activates cycles. Let's erase. Activates major cycles. In this case, from, let's mark it well, from this point of control. Therefore, the potential course we had was up to 61.8 of the new cycle activated here. There it was activated. This area was already a potential bounce area. There were different reasons to exit here. Notice the fall has been impressive. The typical liquidity spots. So then we could have decided where to release those positions. From here, once you release positions, from here you have to start considering buy reasons. Buy reasons from those levels of liquidity. There were different places where I was clear that I would try from that point of liquidity. Besides, from the prior move, as always, we considered the current move. Notice that here we had, once the price is advancing, notice the structure it is leaving. Impulse, retracement, impulse. I want you to keep in mind how it goes making the impulses to levels 200. Impulse, retracement, 200. You notice these small details. And now you also notice the next detail. Impulse, retracement, impulse. 200. This is a reason to buy. Yes or yes. Notice, here we placed seven positions. We have already been taking partial profits, and right now we have a problem. I have a problem. What is the problem? The problem is that we have potential under what I consider. We have two options. Option one, that it might go searching for new highs to this mid-upper area, which is the potential travel of this area of 61. Or we have the option that it might come to make a new failure at some point. There are these two options. So, apart from already taking partial profits in different spots, therefore, not only the operations on the drop, that we took fully, but also these 500 dollars that we carry now on the climb. But why do I tell you we have a problem or that I have a problem? Because look, you know management in protection is an obsession for me. You know I'm constantly urging you that you can't win if you don't know how to lose. Therefore, you know I'm very insistent and I teach you 300,000 different ways to manage well. What's the problem? I speak of management in benefit. Some of you have been with me for a short time, others have been a long time. You know perfectly well that I manage the floating matter a lot. You know perfectly well that when I have a floating that is at 10% of my balance capital, we have 123, we are currently surpassing 10% of floating compared to the balance we have. This needs to be solved. Notice the chart asks me for more, the chart analysis, the price right now is telling me this can go up much more, but I cannot let myself be carried away by that alone. We have strict conditions in loss, but we also need to have strict conditions in gain. And when we go over 10% I always tell you in floating that we have to take profits. We cannot allow this price right now to turn around and eat us more than 10% in profit. It would be for hitting ourselves and hitting ourselves non-stop. Therefore, what am I going to do? These three positions that I currently have now, let's close two, we keep one and this indeed is the one I will let run until final targets. These final targets are up there, halfway opposite zone, around the 5,700 points levels. But even better, even better did silver. We come back again to what we had. Notice the behavior was very similar to gold, completely disproportionate climbs in a completely forced manner until we reached, I'm going to a 15-minute situation, very similar but even better. Hourly chart, remember the two figures I told you? One was to have control point, impulse, cycle and from here one of them was or failure of highs, drop and breakage of levels or upper parts. That red zone wasn't there. What did the price do? Well, something, in my opinion, beautiful. The price makes here an attempt to fall from this 61.8. Well, we always had the option to go seek the failure to work the upper part and no less than it gives us exactly. Fall movement, not only gives us fall movement, it starts breaking internal points, falls, gives us 61, boom, boom, boom. It did it even nicer.",

      "translation": "Let's get to it. Let's see the SP500, we can see it. I attempted longs this morning on SP, it was for longs today, but it took me out and turned around. We still have upside projection for SP, I still think the same. Why, if the map calls for shorts? Let's see. The map calls for shorts. Why does it call for shorts? Let's study why it's calling for shorts. Is it calling for shorts or longs? Let's see. Let's debate this. Why call for shorts? Because it's in a selling zone. Well, the big mistake we always make. As it's in a selling zone, we assume it's for selling. No, it doesn't work like that. We're missing context. I'm not saying it doesn't call for selling. Be cautious, it's in a zone to fall, it's at an edge, so it might fall at any moment. Hence, I don't rule out selling. But why not rule out longs? Because we should be attempting longs as well. Why? Because there's an activated failure. We saw it the other day. Let's see. What did that price do when it entered the zone? What did the price do here? Reaches a small extremity, initiates movement. What happens to that movement origin? Is this a correct movement origin? No. Why not? Because it hasn't reached 25%. Does that mean it can't fall? I'm not saying it can't fall. I'm saying for us, that's not a correct movement origin. And thus, even if it falls, it's most likely to return to 25% again. What does this mean? If the price reaches this level, a failure is activated. What does the price do? Well, it makes a first calm attempt. Yes. Could a short have been attempted here? Yes. But it's most likely to surpass that level because it hasn't reached 25%, because it's a defective extreme. Okay. What does the price do? If it returns to the origin, a failure is activated. That's it. Done. Therefore, I have a projection to go up there. I have a projection to go to 200 or 161.8, which would also be a correct 25% level. Therefore, at either of these two places, the price could stop perfectly. Okay. Notice how here it already surpassed. Here we have 25%. You either try to fall here or come here. What's the problem if you come up here? Well, you are about to touch the highs. I wouldn't be surprised by a spike there. Context? If this happens, would I attempt it here? Yes. If the price breaks this 161.8 and comes to 200, would I try it here? Yes. But I'll give it a buffer for the spike. I'll work that little zone. And here, it's a smaller zone. For sure. Okay. Then, if this has a projection to come to 161 or 200, can't I think of longs? Even though I know it's in a selling zone. I don't renounce either direction. I can't forget that. I can't just go short, short, short, short, as if I'm not seeing this. Context? What happened while the price was in the zone? What has the price done? Where does it stop? Where do we know it can stop? Does it make sense to sell there? Of course. Those are sells. I didn't make them, by the way. I wasn't there. Can we say that's a correct origin? Much more correct than this one. Certainly. Could it come to 200? No doubt. Because we're dealing with indices. We've seen this year. The 161 works much better in currencies, in indices and commodities they fail quite a bit. The 200s are working better. Does that mean I shouldn't make trades here? No. If I were here, I would have done it. Notice how the projection happened. It did it in a disgusting way. What does disgusting mean? Time, time, time, tide, tide, tide, tide, tide. But since the price did this, I already knew it could come here. The only thing I don't know is when or how. These are the things the SP500 has. Notice it's been here all month. So, since the price did this, you could have worked with some internal level to look for longs, without doubt. Sure, because it has the projection to reach up here. Another thing is whether it's worth seeking a minimum ride up to there. 50, 60, 70 points if it compensates you well. We've seen how it did it. Am I surprised that it bounces from here? Not at all. Am I not surprised? Not at all. Another thing is whether I caught it or not. Okay, so if I am at this point and seeing this and seeing it starts to fall, now what would I be observing? Look, when you're looking at a chart, there are only two concepts you can base yourself on. The first concept. How did it do it? The first concept you have to constantly evaluate. How did it do it? And the second, bloody hell, how is it doing it? Past, present, past, present, past, present, past, present, past, present. There is nothing else. There is no future. There is no other data. I cannot stay only with how it's doing it. I have to see how it did it. Why do I have to renounce seeing how it did it? Do I recognize it? Do I not recognize it? Did it interpret? Did it not interpret? What did it do? How is it doing it? There is nothing else. There is no guessing. There is no future. I only have this. I have no more. Therefore, how did it do it? I have seen it and I recognize it. If I don't recognize what it did, for me, it is a problem because it does not make itself objective to me. If it does things that I do not recognize under the method, it complicates analysis for me a lot because I have a method to know if what it did is based on the method or is not based on the method. That is, if here there is an extreme that is not correct, it is objective. If there is a failure here, it is objective. If there is a 161 here, it is objective. If there is a 200 here, it is objective. That is, I need everything to be objective. I cannot base myself on things that are not under method because then I would have no material. That would be guessing. Okay? So, when we talk about how it is doing it, how it’s doing it is also objective. Data that can tell me if what it is doing, if how it is doing it, is recognized or not. What do I want to see? Okay? Then, breakage of previous movement control points. What is the previous movement? The upward one. Okay? What are the relevant control points here? Right, this one. This one. If I want to think that this falling movement has strength, it must break this control point for me. And to break this control point, what has to happen? Objectivity. I don't want to see a strong impulse, I don't want to see a strong rejection. All that is subjective. Objective. It has to reach the 38.2 extension down here. While you don't get here, for me, that decline doesn't have that much power. Objective. Perfect. I mark the level. In each case, logically, the previous movement will leave some control points or others, depending on how the previous movement was. Perfect. More things I want to see to think that this may have a desire to fall. What do I want to see for a price to fall? Okay. Start making lower lows. What do you call that, Juan? Fractal favorability. If you, and here I am going to draw that movement, if you have done this and you are now starting to make that first impulse, like that, okay, well, look, for me to believe that you have the option to get here and consequently break this control point and consequently think that you have potential to fall much more, the first signals I need are for you to do this. You have to give me fractal favorability. It can be smaller, it can be larger, it can be less fractal, more fractal. What I want are clean fractals. What don't I want to see? False breakouts. The more false breakouts you make, the less I will think you have intention. However, I do want to see that with each fractal you make or in those fractals you make, you keep taking out liquidity from the stops. I do want to see this. It is objective, repetitive. I don't want to guess. I know what I want to see and I know what I don't want to see because that gives me indications if that 161.8 level, which apparently is working, I don’t forget that above I have a 200. I need to know if what happens yesterday, today, tomorrow, because this is my daily work, observing the context I have and the data I need to see, if this intends to fall or not. Logically, I will be seeing this on a shorter chart. We're on an hourly chart. Okay? Look, we can go if you want to a 15, which is where I like to observe how you are doing it. I see this. It is the first impulse. The first impulse is the one that gives you the least information. Why? Because there are no fractals, damn it. It’s the first impulse of the first fractal. It doesn’t give you information. Here, someone might say, damn, look how it reached 161.8 and see how strong it fell. Okay? That interests you if you got in up here. Because if I am short here, it interests me a lot that the initial impulse is very strong because I quickly protect the operations. If I’m not short, I'm not interested in it being so fast. Why? Because if I want to join because I didn’t catch that operation, I need a retracement. And I need the deepest possible retracement, so my risk-reward ratio is better. So if I’m short, I want it one way, and if I’m not short, I want it another. Notice that here we have already gone to a short chart. We are already seeing this. But pure common sense says, I have come down from an hourly chart where I have already marked where the extension I want the price to reach to break the control point is. It's called chart history. It's called context. When I come here, what am I seeing? How are you doing it? But I always rely on the previous movement. Always. Okay, damn, if this has to fall, these levels that I didn’t take into account in hourly, you have to break them for me without false breakouts. Without false breakouts. Because these are what are going to tell me if the false breakouts are happening or not. Previous movement, current movement. Previous movement, current movement. Always the same. We don't just stay in what the price is doing. Context. Let's see what it does. Retreat here. For me to be able to join now, I need a deep retreat. I don’t forget that up here I have a 200. I don’t forget. If you give me deep retreats, I can try you. Because I consider that initial movement is good. What did he do? And how is he doing it? There is no more information. 15-minute chart. What am I seeing in that behavior? Is this what I want to see to think it intends to fall? No. What do I want to see? What don’t I want to see? If I see one thing, I think one thing. If I see another thing, I think another thing. Here, did it attempt to fall? Could it break? No. Damn! Did it break any previous relevant minimums I have marked? No. I am thinking here, at this precise moment. The chances of going to 200 are high. I'm not so clear on the shorts anymore. Can I try them? Yes. If you come back here again, I can try you. But it’s not the same to try it here, as to try it when it came here. Why not? Damn, because the information I had here is one, and the information I have here is another. It's not the same case when the price did this. Plop! And now the price did. Boom, boom, boom. It’s not the same. Is it the same zone? Yes. Is it the same? No. Okay, let’s see what happens. For now, I being here, would tell you, look, almost, almost, almost, that I am going to try some long below these liquidity levels. That would be more than a sufficient reason. The moment I see rejection and reincorporation above this level, it’s already more than enough reason for a long. With a target to where? Hell, to 200. What is it going to do? No freaking idea. That’s why I don’t rule out either the short or the long. But for now, what this tells me doesn't seem to have the intent to fall. It’s context. Trading is context, man. The entry point is the last thing; it's all context. Let's see what it does. You’ve made a first attempt, you've failed. This is the second time you try. Do it now. When I mark this level, which confirms to me that the next fractal is correct, the impulse of the next fractal is correct, on the left of the chart, look to the left from where the price is, to the left, what do I see? I see that extension, 138, coincides with a liquidity take. Will it surprise me if the price comes here and bounces? No. Let’s see what happens. Typical chart that I don’t trust a bit, because the context it's making is weak. This fall intention for now has very little. Okay. Typical behavior. Here, plus, takes liquidity again, starts to fall. I have the levels very clear. Come here and we’ll see what happens with this liquidity take. Okay. Typical point. With all the weak context I'm seeing, if I had entered here or if I had entered here, below here is a great level for partial. That's why the first partials. Partials are always taken based on the context of the situation. What do I want to see? What did it do? What does it do? Let's continue. Let’s see what happens there. Damn, you stop. Now what are you going to do here? Well, you have it very easy. Look, either you retreat, or here you start to mess around. Because if you had wanted to break this liquidity take with force, you would have already done it. What I see is you stop and bounce. What intent to fall do you have? Damn, but Joaquín, look at the strong movement it made here. Don’t just focus on how you do those things. Look at what's on the left. What did it do? How did it do it? Don’t just stick to the last movement, man. Let’s continue. You’re messing around. And now, as the movement has already hit the extension, now I do this. I track you entirely. Okay, perfect. I continue with the paranoia. Okay, what are you supposed to do now? Well, look, very easy. Here, next extension. Repetitive. Next extension. What do I find when you reach the next extension? Damn, another liquidity point. Let’s see what happens. You are messing around. You already took this liquidity. This level doesn’t interest me anymore. This liquidity yes, because now there are two levels. Below, what would I be looking for? I am already clear that this level is very relevant just for liquidity. And here I have another liquidity level. It won’t surprise me if the price comes here and pulls, that it comes here and pulls, that it comes here and pulls. Just for pure liquidity.",

      "translation": "Look, when you have a zone, it has reached here and made the corresponding pattern 2. We know we're doing this. At some point, we are waiting for the price to seek some kind of failure or we always have the calm option. Whenever the 161 stays outside, first, we always have the calm option. Are we in agreement up to here? This is repetitive, constantly. Once the price does this, you know that in this case, with this asset that is gold, we work with the 200. If you're trying to follow, imagine the price comes here now, notice it's already proportional. The price is not obliged to go to deception, which is not 100% certain. It's the most probable, but not 100% certain. What does this mean? That perfectly now it can go like this and away, and it's an origin that meets the minimum proportionality. Therefore, I have to say that's a correct origin. What do I do? If I see this starts to fall, what should you be thinking here? It's that the price doesn't want to fall. But if it doesn't want to fall, what's the problem? Of course, when you're in front of a chart, what can't happen is that you say, I don't know what to think. That means there's no method. So, whether it falls or not, or whether it does it one way or another, if you have objective rules, there are no doubts. Another thing is whether the price fulfills your rules or not. Example, in this case, I know that it's most probable to reach up to at least 161.8. What's happening doesn't alter my idea. This is a problem of the noise the price makes before making a decision. This noise cannot affect you. Why doesn't it affect me? Because I don't care what you do. How long you take doesn't matter to me. Why? Because I have established that you have reached a zone, a selling zone, that you have made a pattern 1, a pattern 2, which I measure 100% objectively, there's no doubt about what I have to measure, because I know that the most probable is that you will reach at least 161 and surely 200 and because I know objectively this idea can only break in one way. How? What does this price have to do to take away the idea I just mentioned? If you reach here, my idea changes. So ideas are super clear. The most probable is you reach here, but if before reaching here you reach here, I change the hypothesis. So, one or the other. Furthermore, it will usually do it slowly. What does slow mean? That you will take time, sometimes more, sometimes less, but most of the time, you will drag a lot. Sometimes you'll do it like this, other times you'll do it like this. It doesn't matter how you do it. That is, it doesn't matter how you perform this movement, or you may get here and now fall again. Has my hypothesis changed at all? No. This is called having clear rules. If you get up, you've done the normal. If you fall down, the hypothesis I just presented changes. It's no longer valid. I have to propose another hypothesis. But the hypotheses, one follows the other. Let's see if I can explain. This is the part that needs to be clearest with any system. With any system. Constant hypothesis. Or rather, constant, repetitive action, always the same, always the same, always the same. Therefore, the hypothesis that comes from making that measurement is also always the same. That is, either you reach 200 or you reach extension. That is, the succession of hypotheses, the succession of actions followed by hypotheses, if I have a method, are repetitive. I have nothing to think about. We are never watching, when we have this hypothesis, we're not watching the time it takes to do it. Look, if the price goes up, see how the hypothesis generates action. That is, faced with the two options, you reach the top, you reach the bottom, you reach the top, there's already a planned action. Try sales. Therefore, I already know what I will do if it gets there. So, notice, the price is not there, but the action I will take with the hypothesis that the price reaches the top, I have it clear. Because it is repetitive, it is always the same. It's one of my entry forms. On the other hand, if the hypothesis ends up doing this, that level 200 I no longer want. I no longer care, because you didn't fulfill the initial hypothesis. You did the other one. Therefore, what will I be doing when I see this? Immediately, this level I don't want anymore. Why? Because the next extension along with another failure has just occurred. Therefore, here what it now asks for, option 1, either I attack calmly this movement now yes, or you go to the next failure, which is another level. Therefore, I have again, notice how the price right now, imagine it did this, it touched the extension below the pattern 2 measurement, hypotheses change, but actions become clear again. What do you want to see to enter? Let me give you an example. Notice, for example, in this drawing I have a level, another level, another level and another level. Imagine that same figure, instead of doing it like that, did it like this. Look, I will draw you the same movement of pattern 1, pattern 2, identical. Even this movement that activated pattern 3, but for example now I do it like this. Notice how I would be doing exactly the same as before this, but notice how here now I do it differently. And now that price, instead of making the figure it did there until reaching the extension, now it does it this way. The fact is the same. What is the same fact? Activated pattern 3, activated failure, but touched extension. The fact is the same, but how it did it, no. We constantly throw at how it will do it. No, what did it do, how did it do it. Okay, it failed, but how did it fail. So, notice, faced with these two forms I wouldn't act the same. Why? Look, it is more probable in this figure that right now, that we should be doing like this in both cases, always from the highest point. When I talk about how it did, this is something you have to train really hard, how it did it, not imagining how it will do it. How it did it, how it validated, how it broke. What is the difference between these two concepts that have exactly the same fact? Very easy. Here there is liquidity, here there is liquidity, and here there is liquidity. However, here all the liquidity is on top. Damn, it's not the same, my friend. What does it mean? That here, here on the left, I'm sure that on this 61.8 I don't enter. I'm sure I don't take that calm. However, here it is likely that I do, because I take two liquidity points. Not only do I look at whether it broke or didn't break the previous hypothesis. No, I also care how you broke it because my concept is always to enter where there is liquidity. Therefore, it is very probable that here, notice, that here I may even make an attempt to yoga again. Here it is very likely that here you make some attempt. On the other hand, it is possible here that if you make a small extreme, I try. Normally, when we look for methodologies, we look for ABC, ABC, ABC, but I am constantly trying to instill the context concept. Contexts make there are better options or others depending on how it did. Every time this case occurs, I will always attack calmly. That is a mistake because what you are saying is that all contexts are the same. Sure, the concept of the reason why you enter if it is the same because you say hey there is a failure that was not fulfilled, it touched extension, I enter calmly. Yes, if you say I stay there. Okay, but your job is to see this too. We have the ability to look at a context because here the same thing is happening, but you will understand it's not the same. It's not the same case. It is the same concept. Yes, it has failed and I enter calmly. Yes, it is the same case, yes, yes. But if you see this case, don’t enter here because most will fail. However, there are many more options for this one to work. I'm not saying maybe neither works, but if I have to invest money, I'd rather invest it in this calm than in this one. That is, there are modifications, modifications. We have a general line, a very constant and repetitive line of work. Yes, but there are modifications that are given by a context of what happened, which is what we look at the least of what happened, and for me, it’s vital.",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Let's start with the tricky part, the gold, let's see what we have. Very good, Luis. Ok, we position ourselves, once again. Do we all agree with this map? Yes, right? Good. Last point of control, once again the price made us reshape the map. We have a cycle at 38, we can mark zones. The price continued to work, rebounded at these levels, and gave us room to work a downtrend cycle. This downtrend cycle. Downtrend cycle, well, typical trades that you know I like. Here we had a dilemma in this area. The dilemma was the following. Once the price arrives here, the price falls. Option number one to consider was the failure, 200. We had the first option there. That was a sell yes or yes. And then when the price activates the failure. It was a complex situation. By definition, the sell was there. The sell was that. But logically, when the price comes to work extreme zones. You know that these are the typical trades where I have to take action yes or yes. It coincided with level 138 of the failure. Sorry, 161.8 of the failure. It was not level 200. But here, level 161.8 practically at the end of the extreme zone. It coincides with the perfect entry. Not the perfect entry, my preferred entry. Every time this situation occurs, I will sell. I will make the first attempts. The price reacts. At the moment the price reacts. It falls, falls, falls, falls, falls. Well, we take partials. First for protection. Second at level 38 of red. At the moment the price touches this level of the opposite extension. That level of the opposite extension. We have already talked about these kinds of things. I discard this level. Level 200 no longer interests me. I accept 161.8 as valid. To show you the complexity here, right? Sometimes 161 works well. Other times 200 works. It's a damn mess. In this case, since the price touched here. That gave me this second partial. I discard that level. As long as the price didn't reach here. The price can react perfectly at level 161 at any moment. At any moment. And it would be totally correct. But when it falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, bang. And touches the opposite extension. I completely cancel level 200. I accept that level as valid. From here on, well, we go back to the same old story. What is it going to do? Where do we take profits? Regardless of those first partials. The question is how far this price can go, right? If we keep mapping, we could observe. That we could even be working. This movement. We could even be working on that. That would be. A cycle 3. And we see that it is reacting very well. At extreme. These are already the first dangers. That's why that level. 38. Was a very good place to take possible partials. From those sells. And right now we would have this, right? I never rule out the topic of purchases. This is a buying zone. Without a doubt. We are beginning to have the thought of. Option of hedges. Of taking long positions. What I think I could do. And this is my bet. My initial bet. Is this drawing. This, to think about this drawing. At first glance. If you notice. I have another partial here. And I've got another partial here. This is simply a projection. It is what I would like it to do. I know where the price is right now. I know it's in a rebound option. And as always, right? Once more. We will now look at the SP500. That one thing is that the entry is good. And another thing is that it pays. No matter how hard we try for the perfect entry. If it doesn't pay, it's worth nothing. We return to the same situation. We have a movement in favor that yes. That already has partials. But that is not a winner. That is positive. Which is different. Why do I have this forecast marked here? It is one of the many. This perfectly now can go like this. And go to hell upwards. And break it all. Well, because right now. I am evaluating 2 options. The first option would be. The failure of this movement. That would give us a level of this type. Here. The 200 of this failure. Would work. This area down here. Let’s say in theory. It would be the maximum potential path. That I would like to pursue. Logically, I still have 3 positions. This would be one. That would exit here. I would take out another one here. For this reason that I will explain. We already see the reason why I would take out here. We already see it. Without a doubt this is a buying zone. Without a doubt. There I will try to buy. And once more. Repetitive. I will be very attentive to the work it does. In this 61 zone. And this other level that I have marked here. Is given by the failure. What it is doing now in the brown zone. If I look right now. What it is doing in the brown zone. What I would like is this failure. This failure. If right now the price. Is originating a movement. What I want. Is for it to fail. And when it fails. This level is activated for me. That is why I have marked. The next point of profit taking there. Therefore. There are two very key levels. In this situation. To be able to think whether or not. That this path makes sense. If the price comes here. This is a reason for buying. But I wouldn't do that buy. However, here. It is 100% sure that yes. Because if this goes up. What would the projection be. The projection would be for it to go. To several places. If this happened. Logically, one would have to measure. The entire fall. And here we would have different scenarios. Scenario number 1. If it goes up. We would return to 61.8% zone of the total cycle. First place where the price. Could fall again. If the price. Breaks that level. Next target 200. So this purchase. It interests me a lot. In other words. This one yes. Because no matter how little path it could provide. The target is this one. That middle zone. Logically, one would have to reshape the map. Because the red cycle. Would be evolved. We would have to mark new. Zones of the fall. With new high parts. New 61 zone. New low part. The evolution would have to be done. The red cycle would be broken. And the potential path. I don't know. It's an 80 dollars rise. Zone where without a doubt. I would take partials. Of the possible purchases. Regardless if in the middle. Some partial could be taken. Here a partial would be taken yes or yes. And without a doubt as well. It would be a sales zone. Coverage for sure. Gold has picked up speed. How do you like gold Iñaki? How he laughs that he's sold the bastard! Look at him!",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Okay, let's do a little review of what we have, and I'd like to progress with another asset today, the EUR/USD, and start charting it. Let's reconsider what we have in the SP500. We had seen the situation we were in; we were coming from the high part, coming from a pattern, where we discussed levels of 161.8 of the pattern, and most likely the level S200. I still think it's an illogical and unhealthy rise, and sooner rather than later, this rise will correct. But seeing what we are seeing, I always tell you that from S161 of failure to S200, that's a zone that, logically depending on the size of the pattern, can be very large. Notice that here we have a zone of 90 points between those two levels, to which we would have to add the 25% zone of that level. So, we have 200 points where the price is likely to make a significant retracement. I'm not saying it will be a trend change, but at least a significant retracement. Looking at what we have here, to show you some of the entries I have placed there, once I see that the 161.8, the price reaches the 161.8, let's get closer. Once the price reaches this level, we have different options. Always, and please remember the behavior I'm going to explain to you. Look, we have the first option that the price falls at that 161.8 level, yes, but we also know that the price can go to the 200 level, okay? So, as we discussed, we have a very wide zone there. What I do tell you is the following: if this first level does not behave well, if this first 161.8 level, I'm always emphasizing the importance of the 200 level in indices and commodities, but I also always tell you that it is normal for the price to try to react at that 161.8. If the price does not manage, in this case, to go down from that 161.8, it is most probable that the price, to reach that level, will do it based on failures. That is, if on this first attempt the price doesn't want to go down like it happened here, notice it made a first attempt, made a first attempt, most likely at the moment this price already tells us from here that indeed this level is not correct, it will keep doing it with a high probability in failures. Failures that can keep doing 161.8, new attempt and new failure, for example, I'm giving you an example, and from there it will keep making constant failures to go to a new 161 or to a new 200 and from there it falls again and from there it generates a failure after another, but it usually respects the 161 or the 200 until it manages to reach that 200 level. It often does it that way and especially does it like this when the pattern or when the size of these two levels, the distance between these two levels is very large. If this were a 5-minute pattern, it might not do this. It doesn't even have time. But when we are talking about long-term behaviors, of high distances, it is very likely that it will behave this way. And indeed, it is behaving this way. Look, let's see what happened from the moment the price did this. Look, I come to do this, indeed from here we can make different attempts, but the moment the price starts to make this first attempt, this first attempt we already see it fails. And that is what I'm telling you, right? These first failures, notice we have a very large distance to the 200 level, very large, that is, but to get there, it will usually do so like this. Notice how it respects again the 161-8 level. All these levels are already attempts of possible sales, yes, they are attempts that the price could already fall, but every time it fails, notice how it falls again a certain distance. Now we will talk about how I can, how I try to work with these small moves, but ultimately they don't give us the target. If you realize, the moment the price does this, fails again, there, fails again. That 161-8 attempt fails, if we take the new level and measure the new attempt, notice how the price ultimately returns again to these levels. Remember that 161-8-200 is still a zone, it is still a zone. Always remember the importance that I always give to the zone thinking, not to an exact level. Notice how the price wants to try to fall again, tries to fall, returns again to those failure levels, to the same level of movement origin, and if we take the FIBO again and mark the movement made again, we realize that it respects in this case the 200 level. These entries you see here have no merit because they are entries with pending orders. I was not in front of it. They are entries, pending orders disturb me because I can't be there, I can't be monitoring them. More or less, I programmed those entries when I saw the price was roughly here when I saw the failure was roughly here, more or less, I programmed those entries. But they have no merit on my part, honestly. Notice how now the price makes a new attempt. Logically, every time one of these attempts is produced, I will put them in another color, notice how they are different attempts that the price makes, failed attempts, like the movement we are attempting right now. All this, notice how there is a movement where we understand where we are, we understand we are in a selling zone, we know we have a level above, 200 level, 200 level zone, which is most likely once the price has failed, the 161.8 of the pattern. The problem is in these attempts. Here we always have the contradiction. Okay, Joaquín, if you are telling me that it is most likely that the price will reach those levels, why don't we try to take long positions? I tell you, you are absolutely right, absolutely right. And I tell you more, we could, don't know if you realize that every time we have a pattern figure like this, don't know if you realize, every pattern figure, every possible failure figure, don't know if you realize it actually leaves a point of control. Every time we have this, we have a point of control. In this case, of the rise. If it were the opposite, it would be of the fall. If we wanted to take advantage of the upside, we should rely on those points of control. We should be trying to join at least that move to the 200 level that remains, we should be trying at every level we see that here it comes to the 161.8 zone, these would be good long attempts. Yes, they would be good long attempts. Notice how it did it here, right? What is the problem? The problem is that, notice, we have the contradiction, right? We know we are in a selling zone, we know it is not respecting well the 161.8 level that we have here. Notice how this could have been a good buying level. That is, a sale could be attempted at failure 1, but a purchase could also be attempted. What is the problem? Notice that when the price starts to make points of control like this or like this, notice that here it did give perfectly the 161.8 level to be able to join in, it could have been tried there, but notice that afterwards it is no longer so easy to join in long. This is what we've been talking about since the first day, right? Movements with such short fractality make it very complex for us to join long. This does not mean that I am not thinking about long, huh? I am always thinking about trying to join the movement and especially when maybe there's 100 points left to go up at the outset, but it's not easy. It's not easy to join long. There is no, if you realize, there are no pullbacks. Notice how this pullback is already very short and here there's no option to join. So, it's not easy. Even knowing you have a potential range, I always tell you when we do the training, right? Even if I guarantee you that the price is going to rise 200 points, even if I guarantee you and say it's 100% sure the price will rise 200 points, it's not easy to still join and take those moves. If we want to apply method, if we want to apply method. It's another thing to join in another way, but if I don't have a method to join, I don't join. So it's easy to see afterwards, right? But when the moves are so vertical to our system, which is of fractality, with medium dignified retracements, minimum at 61.8, if this doesn't happen, it's complex. It's complex.",

      "translation": "We will continue with what has happened since the last day. One of the things I like to see with you in these sessions is seeing what happens, what happened, since we left the last session, seeing how the chart progresses. For me, it is one of the most important things, how we have to keep reading through the method what is happening, and we will always be able to make better decisions today if we have seen in detail what is happening. We will do it with gold. We had already explained all that drop, we had already explained all this, we had already taken profits, we had already described all this. Let's see what happened from here, from where we left it, I think we were around here. Notice, the approach we had was a projection to go to the high red zone, so, we had an important upward projection. We had talked about levels around 5700. Regardless of that maximum area, let's say travel limit, we had an intermediate area, which was the cycle of decline, this blue area, which could jeopardize the travel up to the high red part. From here, with this context, let's see what happened because it is very interesting. Always keep in mind the double direction. That is, I do not know if it will reach the high zone with potential objectives or if it will fail. Therefore, I do not rule out purchases or sales. Notice how here, when fractality begins to behave in a coherent manner, in a typical, 'normal' manner, notice how here we can have many work options. What I would be doing at this moment is starting to draw the possibility of complete cycles. The origin of the movement, as always, complete Fibo. At the moment the price begins to touch 38, purchase zones become activated. Logically, we also unravel the rise through control points. This would be a first control point. Therefore, I would also be doing something like this. And, of course, if the price creates new control points, they will have to be worked with. Then, notice what the price did. Finally, the price activated us here. So we had this last control point here. I am already trying for this price to activate this cycle. Well, I am trying, no. I am waiting for that price to activate that cycle for a first certain attempt at a low zone. Let's see what it did. Notice how the price here at a given moment activates that cycle, which means I already have a low zone here. Here I also have a level concurrence. I have the blue level, the blue 38. This coincidence of the low area with blue 38 is already a yes or yes reason to buy. The price comes here. This is buy. From there, I would also be marking. Notice how it already activated this 61.8. In my case, if I make an entry operation here, right there, well, obviously we have the stop clear, and the partial is also clear. The red. When the price comes here, that is a partial. The typical protection partial I always tell you is the one that protects the rest of the entry. Let's see what it does. There we have it. This is a reason for a partial, yes or yes. Notice how the price stops a bit there and what it just activated me, opposite cycle. Therefore, the danger, where do we have it when we are in this situation? First at the red level, which will act as resistance for sure. We will see to what extent or not. And if not, the 61 of decline. Of course, this zone no longer exists, and now a new low zone is presented, which is the cycle of decline. Perfect. Let's see what happened. The price comes. Danger. The price returns to a low zone again. You have to try again here. Perfect. Bought again. Okay. We return to the same story. We would now be pending the evolution. We mark the evolution here. Notice that it coincides with the purple 38. Perfect. Cycle that breaks another cycle. Notice, here is the pure state of the methodology. The constant evolution of broken cycle, activation of the next. But as you see, it is simple. It is simply carrying out the sequence well done. We now have a new downward cycle activated here. We have a sales zone here again. And now what we have is the activation of everything. We now have everything completed. That is, it has fallen so much that we already have everything we had to have from below. Now the purple zone is a buy zone. Now the brown zone is also a buy zone. Now we have the activation from here, from here, and from the fall. Therefore, right now, we are in this situation. I don't know if you realize we have a 38, a 38, a 38, and a 38 here. That is, we have here a very powerful 38 zone. This will be very difficult both up and down. And it is probably that it might be locked here, hitting one point, hitting the other. That is, bouncing off the red, then bouncing off the purple, or then bouncing off the brown. It is very typical. However, when it exits this zone, the normal thing is it does so powerfully. And when we have this type of concurrence of information, it is possible that the price at some point makes a very strong break, although then it could be to do this, or vice versa, that it breaks down strongly, but in reality, it is a deception to come back up again. But you must be very vigilant about how it does this. You must be very vigilant. Then, you must understand that we are in a dangerous zone. Dangerous in the sense that it is powerful. Let's see what happens. Red, blue, brown, purple. The million-dollar question. How are you doing it? I, logically, already took a partial from this purchase. What do you have to say about this? Is it doing well? Is it doing poorly? We are trapped in this zone. We continue trapped here. Here is my purchase. But notice how here it remains indecisive. If I had to tell you today what is most likely to happen here, the most likely is that it will not surpass upwards now. That it will not surpass upwards now. It will depend a lot on this impulse it is making now. The most likely thing is it makes a movement downwards. Strong, powerful. And it will encounter these two zones. From one of these two zones, it is possible that the price rebounds very strongly as well. If you see that the price stays here again standing and starts doing this again, the most likely thing is it falls further. If this operation takes me out, it will break with strength. What could I consider right now? If the price now does this, the failure I will initially take will be this one. Very high probability that it will get here at a minimum. At a minimum. And if it comes here and does this, this movement I would bet will be strong.",

      "translation": "Once we've set the stage, we consider the origin of the brown movement and the potential course in the blue zone. If the price hits this level, a failure is activated. We always come back to the same story, that if it's ABC, it's always the same every day, looking a bit at the context. From there, it would cause a failure with a projection to 200. We'd be talking about these levels. We'd retest new highs and make new peaks. Well, let's hope this is what I'm looking for here. Tell me, regarding what's happening in that purple area. The failure, of course. The moment the price touches again and again, always the same. The origin of the movement activates a failure for me. If this happens, I have the potential to reach here, at level 200. That would mean entering a new zone, and the purple would be completely broken. If this happens and the price comes here, I can't believe the price won't break the liquidity that's there. I don't believe it. That's why I have one of the goals there, right? Of these last two, I already cashed out a partial. Of these last two, there would be a first target. Why do I have a second target here? Well, because it's the middle zone. Because here, there are imbalance levels. Not only here but also from behind four hours. Well, it's a level to gain a bit more ground. And there's the final objective, right? Let's say now I'm playing with the advantage. Since we're still holding with 2 from below, those are the ones I'm letting run. So if the price makes the failure of this movement. Then, let's say I am playing in the, in quotes, intraweek or intraweekly. Call it what you will. With the last ones, but the ones I'm really letting run are the initial ones we entered the other day. Notice how also, and this is the part that's more costly to suffer. Well, costly to suffer if you don't tolerate it. Notice how from this initial position we entered a while ago. With several we've already taken different partials and such. Notice all the process the price has done, right? You have to endure all this. If we can't endure holding a position for all these problems the price may give us. We'll never have a super-winning trade. Never. Never. So we have to be aware that if we want to have one or several trades throughout the year. Because in the end, how many of these trades can we take in a year? If we're sharp. 20? 15? I don't know. It also depends on how sharp you are that year, right? But even so, you always catch, right? In a good year, you can catch many, and those are the ones that really give you the profit. Because afterward, you keep incorporating into the movement. If they go well, you keep adding, adding, adding, adding, adding. Then, of course, you end up in a movement that starts here, and who knows, ends up there. That's a big deal. It's not just with the original position but with everything you're doing. In the end, when you get here and you break everything. Because eventually, you have to cash everything out at some point. We can't support this forever. It sums up a lot of money. Those are the trades you really say, wow, the account goes up beautifully. If we can't endure or have this tolerance, we can't expect to have this type of trades. We can't expect a movement that comes here to go straight up. That's not going to happen in 99.9% of cases. A super-powerful movement, right? The normal thing is that it does this. A movement like this. Now it will rise. Now it will stop around here again. It might even make a hard retracement. Then it can go up. We'll take advantage to keep incorporating. This is a kind of trade that requires, is a type, a style of long-range trades. Which are the ones that give you big profits. Because here we don't win based on leverage. We win based on range. We never sacrifice risk to make a lot. Here, the risk is sacred for us. Therefore, yes, or it will take us out. Or suddenly it comes here and, to hell with it, does this. Well, if you don't try, you never have it. This is a lot of working with fear, right? The fear of loss. Not the fear of loss, the fear that maybe here you have 3,000 euros. Right now if you close. But you can get 7,000, 8,000 if you hold on. So, what do we prioritize? Normally fear acts. And fear says, look, I'd rather have 3,000. Then, we're never able to get past 3,000. What am I saying? That in the end, everyone has their limit, their pain. Even in profit. That pain, you have to overcome little by little. But understand that the only way to overcome that is to endure these kinds of things the price will do to us. In the majority of cases, when we want to let a range run. This is not learned because I say it. It's learned by doing it, trying it. Always when you're willing to let it run is for 2 reasons. The first is that in the original position you've already made some profit. That's why I work with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions in the trade. So you pull some profit, and there's a point where it's already profitable. That trade is profitable. From there, you understand there are potential ranges you estimate and let them run. Because one very important thing. Look, what's the advice I would give if you want to train this? When you're doing this. When you're entering there with 2, 3, 4, 5 positions depending on how you're entering. You already need to know where you're going to let it run. I mean, the first thing I do when I put 2 or 3 trades here is the first to decide where I'm going to take partials. Where I already take for granted that this trade is not going to cost me money. That's one hand, which is why it's the first partial that secures the rest. And then where I start to add. But when you're doing this, any trade. And I'm talking when you don't go to a fixed ratio. If you go to a fixed ratio, you'll never have a super-winning trade. That's obvious. It's easier to accept psychologically. But in life, you'll have a super-winning trade. Never in life do you work basis of bang, bang, bang, bang. Same ratio, same ratio, same ratio. It's much easier to manage mentally. When you have that fixed ratio management dominated. You then expand your mind and ability to stretch, stretch, stretch. Because you handle it better psychologically. Then this happens. Where am I going to let it go if it goes up? The secret, at least the one that works for me. The one that works for me doesn't mean it's the best. But it's one of the ways I've been training it. Well, it is to decide where you're going to exit when you enter. I mean in the end, in the end. I insist that the first thing is to decide on the partials. But you have to set a final. Am I going to try for a super-winning trade? Yes, okay. You'll decide if with one position or two of the ones you've entered. In this case, there are two. Okay, perfect. But when I'm entering there, I have to decide this already. Why? Because it's easier for me to manage mentally. If I don't decide before doing it or at least immediately after doing it. I'm going to have a lot more doubts. But a lot more doubts. So, to make an example, when I do this or when I make this entry, then I don't know if it will reach where I want it or not. Most times, it will not. But when it does, it shows a lot on the account. That's why I say maybe a year you have 15. That do reach the assumption you made initially. 15 or 20, whatever. Or 10 or 12, whatever it is. But most won't reach. Understand me. If I see this, planning this plan. Imagine that entry. I take for granted that these trades I will let them go to the failure of the blue. That is, when I'm seeing this scenario, I decide to take the option to go to failure. That is, those trades will exit there. There. And if it doesn't reach, the hell with it, let it take me out. In that range my trade will have already added enough. To consider it a winner. That's why I work with different shots. There's a moment when the trade is already a winner. Even if the rest, these two that remain, fail. Therefore, my numbers add up. Let's say this is the extra. That I'm saying hey, look I take the risk. Or I make the decision to seek the failure. So, of course, when you do this. Many times a year. Most times it won't do this. Of course not. Because it will fall from here. Or it will come to 61, make a second blue work. And will go down again and come to this low area. Therefore to hell with it. That is to say, most times I am aware it won't do it. But when it does, that is a big boost. Not a moral boost. No, no. In the end, you get happy. But it's no longer... It's like... Well, okay, good. The problem arises when you don't decide this. At that moment. Why? Because if it's not decided. And in an objective, clear way. Why? And because of my guts. That I'm not exiting until it gets to the failure. And I don't care if it gets there or not. When you encounter this. When you encounter these erratic price movements. Which it will make a lot. Or several. Before reaching that failure. It's going to make many movements of this kind. Then, you can't be intimidated. Seeing this kind of behavior. You already made the decision when you did it. You already took it. So, don't back down. Because in that upward movement, your trade is already a winner. Okay, perfect. Now, give it the chance. For the price to do that. Then tell me how the hell you have that super-winning trade. It's impossible.",

      "translation": "Let's refresh what happened with the SP500. Nothing new compared to what we saw yesterday. I still think the same. We have two activated failures. Remember how important it is to bring the history of what we did the last day. We have two activated failures. Therefore, we have different zones where the price should, with high probability, reach. Therefore, we talked about the price needing to rise more. Yesterday, we also mentioned that by taking advantage of these internal points of control, we could be working on some type of buying area around these levels. But we also said that we could take advantage of any liquidity grabs that the previous movement is leaving us. Notice where it stops at the 38.2 of the point of control. Notice how it takes liquidity from various points. From 1, 2, 3. This area is a must. This is a buy, no doubt. There is no lack of method. If you did it very well, Juan, we have to start knowing how to work with liquidity grabs. Only with this I've always told you and I've never tired of repeating that just with this you can work. Only with this you can have a methodology, a strategy, a work strategy. Only with this. Now I'll take advantage that I'm saying this. You know I like to address queries you make to give you some reflection. Now that we're talking about strategies and that simply these liquidity grabs could already be a reason for work, a way to value, it always amuses me when people see, most of you I assume came to me because you've seen the free YouTube course, but it always amuses me a lot when I'm asked questions like this. Hey Joaquín, I'm following your strategy, the one in your YouTube course and I'd like to ask you some questions and such. Let's see, now that we're talking about strategies, this came up out of the blue. When you work with charts, you need two fundamental things. First, a way of reading and interpreting the chart and another way to execute the chart. These are two very different things. When we talk about reading the chart, that's what the YouTube course on my channel shows you. That course and all those videos, in no way, in no way, show you a strategy. In no way. That is not the purpose of showing you a strategy. That is a model, a way to read the charts. Of course, any methodology needs to have a way to read the charts. We have it through cycles and that is the only thing shown in those YouTube videos. A way to read the chart, to locate yourself on a chart, a way to select work zones. Period. The strategy is much more complex. A strategy already requires what we have often said about what kind of risk management you have, what kind of entries you make, what kind of exits you make, what kind of post-entry management you do. That is, how you manage everything. That is the strategy. Combined with the way you read the chart, it gives you the method. When people tell me, no, I'm following the strategy that you teach in your YouTube course. But when did anyone say that that is a strategy? That is a reading model. The strategy is much more complex and, above all, much more individual. What we have repeated so many times. To make it a bit clearer, what I mean by all this, notice how the reading model of the method tells us that the price can reach these levels. That is one thing. The reading puts you there, tells you, hey, the reading model indicates that the price, with high probability, can get up here. Even if the price falls, we said yesterday, if the price falls, the reading model tells you that because the price needs to rise up, at a certain point purchases could be attempted. The model also tells you, when the price reaches these levels, we should make some sales attempts. This is what the YouTube course teaches you. These are reading models, they position you, they locate you, they say it's probable that the price can go here or it's probable that the price can go there. That is the only thing those YouTube courses teach. Now we could say, okay, then, as I have already positioned myself with this model, and now it's a bit about why this whole thing came out, I'll tell you, look, a strategy that supports this reading model could simply be the liquidity grabs, okay? If I'm clear that the price, with high probability, should at least reach these levels, which I have no idea if it will or not, but my model, which is the one I have to follow, the model I have chosen, tells me that the price can rise up here, okay? Then I'm going to attack the price through a strategy, for example, of liquidity grabs. That's why I say this strategy of attacking the price is very valid. No patterns are needed, no stories are needed, it's much simpler. Sites of liquidity grabs, in this case, that break low points, because my model says the price has to rise more. If I remember correctly, we marked them the other day, I'm going to take these levels, which are the levels that give me the reference for the attack strategy, and before this, I'm going to have rules to attack the price. No fucking cycle is needed because the cycles have already positioned you, people mix everything, people mix method, reading, attack, strategy, people don't know what they are talking about. Why do I tell you this? Because I constantly get queries, Joaquín, the strategy you use, but how do you know the strategy I use? If you don't know how I enter the market, if you don't know the management I use, if you don't know how I exit, if you don't know the post-entry I do, but you have no idea of my strategy. People believe those videos seen on YouTube are my strategy. No, that is a reading model. What's more, there are no two students who trade the same. All strategies are different because the trader is different. Be careful with these concepts, don't get confused with this. It's very important that you are very clear about what each thing is. Here we could use a model to attack the price simply for this, because the price in theory could rise more. I could wait also for points of liquidity. Imagine there is no zone here. I can also wait here. This is a way to attack the price already. Because I have the reference of my reading form. What I can't have is a strategy to attack the price if I don't have a map location. That's what I should never have. I have to have a reading model and an attack model. That is, in this case, I am looking for purchases because my reading model asks to rise. Notice how even what I'm telling you is that the cycles model positions me. I might not even need the work zones to attack the price. I can use other types of ways to attack the price. Other types of strategies to attack the price. Of course, since you show in your videos some entry patterns, look, I teach you some, but there are a thousand ways to attack the price. Look, here are liquidity grabs that I don't teach in the videos. But this is trading 101. You don't need to understand much to know that if the price goes up, it's most likely grabbing some liquidity from here. It's trading 101. So you don't have to exclusively follow some of the patterns I tell you. That's not necessary. What I want is for you to have the complete model. And if you find it better to use liquidity points or liquidity grabs to execute, do it. People get very confused with this. When I talk to someone and talk about strategy, everyone has a different concept of strategy, everyone has a different concept of system, everyone has a different concept of method and this is a big mess. No. Reading model, attack model, and all that outlined with management. Point.",

      "translation": "It's always best to see it on the chart, so let's look at it on the chart. Let's take any movement for example. You will notice that the methodology, at different moments, will ask you to break down, as I call it. We have to break down a movement to locate its correct points of control. We have to do it in two ways. One, when the movement is already done, the method will tell you at a given moment that you need to break down using points of control, for instance, this rise. Look, from this low, let's suppose we go to this high, and we need to break down, using points of control, the whole rise. I want you to notice the protocol we will follow. Remember, minor fractals lead to major fractals. Minor fractals become obsolete, leading to major fractals. A fractal is an impulse movement that must leave a peak. It must have a sequence of two candles to the left, two candles to the right. Once that happens, I'll have my first fractal. Agreed? Let's see it on the chart. From any origin point, the price rises until it leaves its first high. This peak has two closed candles to the left and two to the right. That means I have my first fractal. There it is. Well, for me to say I have a correct point of control, I need the price to surpass the fractal high by at least a third of the retracement height. Perfect. I need the price to surpass that level, at least by a third of the retracement's height. Notice I do this very simply. Look, I measure that height. And I say, look, you have 122 pips. I take my calculator, put it here and say, look, 122 divided by 3, by that third, you must surpass at least 40 pips. Perfect. Notice. The price makes a first attempt. Do you surpass 40 pips that level? 26! No! False breakout! False breakout! The price makes a first attempt. False breakout! The price makes a first attempt of false breakout. No! We continue laterally within that first fractality. What does the price do? The price makes a lower low. The price makes a lower low. It's no longer that point I have to validate. It's no longer that. Now we have a different height. Now it becomes that. Right now the point I would have to validate is this. You have to break the origin high of the fractal by at least a third. Now you make another new attempt. I will measure the new height from the same origin point. There. Now you have 163 pips. I take my calculator. 163 divided by 3. 54 pips. You have to break above the fractal high, not the false breakout, by 53 pips. Perfect. I'm going to see if you have broken above 53 pips there. Here we have. Here there's already a breakout. There's already a breakout and therefore I can say this point is validated. I only care about that lower point. What has happened here ultimately? A slow retracement with a false breakout. A slow retracement leaving me a valid point of control. And I can say that the real retracement of that slow retracement is that point of control that is already validated. Therefore, I go to the point where you left me the first high once you reached the minimum required to consider you a breakout. There I see it leaves me that first high. Perfect. I have my first retracement, my first fractal, with my first correct point of control. I continue. We have new retracement. I'm going to ask you for the exact same thing. Now it's that point you have to surpass by a third of the new measurement of the new fractal we have. 105 pips. Calculator. 105 pips divided by 3. 35. Perfect. You have to surpass above that level by around 105 pips for me to say this new point is validated. The lowest point. This is the level I have to validate. Perfect. We have a clear surpassing and we go up to the new high it might leave us. The new high it might leave us. There it is. I already have two points of control. And be careful with what I am going to tell you now. When there is a sequence of fractals in the same direction leaving us points of control, those points of control will have a degree, a height. This retracement that has been validated and thus left us that point of control has a height. While retracements of lesser height occur ahead, they will be valid. But if a retracement of greater height, what we call of greater degree, occurs ahead, this retracement and that point of control disappears. That point of control will no longer serve at any time. That is, if right now the price makes a smaller retracement than the previous one, of lesser height, and that retracement is validated, both are correct. They would be correct places for us to look for cycle possibilities. But beware, if at any time ahead a greater retracement occurs, either greater than this one or greater than this one, or of both, both would disappear. That is, if the price at any time makes a retracement of greater degree than any of the two previous ones, if that point is validated, not before, if that point surpasses a third above that level, the two previous points of control will have become obsolete. Minor movements lead to major movements. If this happens, that point becomes completely validated, therefore obsolete, obsolete and the real movement we would have on the chart would be great impulse, great retracement, great impulse. Constant evolution of fractality. Greater degree retracements nullify lesser degree retracements. Look here, look at the height of this retracement, look at the height of this retracement. Every time I validate one, I must ask myself, does this new point of control, that retracement that has just been validated, have any lesser degree retracement behind it? The answer is no. This retracement continues to be greater than the one I just marked, therefore, both are correct. Perfect. And I go to the next high. Here it is. The price starts to retrace. There you leave me a new high. Well, I'm going to take. You have to break above that level at least a third of the retracement. You don't break. You make a lower low. The height is changing. You have to break a third above the maximum of the new fractal. We measure. Look. We have 120 pips. You have to surpass 40 pips above. Let's see if you get it here. Yes, 46. Therefore, what you are telling me is that the point is validated, because there we have a breakout. I can say that this point is validated. I stop. Is there any lesser retracement behind that is of lesser degree? Let's see. This retracement we said had 120 pips. Let's see how much the previous one has. It seems less. 115. Therefore, that point of control, it is clear that the one behind isn't, but that point of control is lesser than its next correct fractal. Therefore, that retracement is dead, that point of control is dead and what really is happening up to this moment in the chart is impulse, retracement, impulse and retracement. Perfect. We do it again. Now we go to the maximum of the new fractal. Now the price has to break up there since it is the first place where it left us maximum after the breakout. You have to surpass above that level the height of the retracement you are leaving. The price falls, falls, falls. Look, I observe that the retracement I am seeing is already greater than the previous one, it surpasses its level. This means that it is the first warning that if the price surpasses that level, that last point of control I have will surely become obsolete. The price falls, its height is increasing, its height is increasing, there it seems it wants to break. We measure. Look, we have 330 pips. Let's give it 110. You have to break 110 pips. There you give me the 110 pips and therefore you leave the first high after the breakout, you tell me you are validated, we go there, point of control validated. I observe, is there any lesser degree retracement behind? Yes, therefore, obsolete. These are no longer the real movements, they were at their time, but here we have had an evolution of fractality. Great impulse, great retracement, great impulse. Minor movements lead to major movements, over and over, over and over. Points of control becoming obsolete, we need to know when a point of control is no longer valid and that implies there has been an evolution to greater fractality. We continue, the price starts to make a high here, perfect, I already have a new fractal, we start again. You don't break, you keep making depth, you keep making depth, you have to break above that level a third of your height, we measure, we have 145 pips, I don't complicate, 145 divided by 3, 48 pips, perfect. I measure, you had to break 48 pips, there I have them, there you left a high, two closed candles to the right below the peak point, perfect. Point validated. Do we have any lesser retracement behind this that I just validated? No, therefore it is valid, perfect, notice, high, I start again. Minor movements lead to major movements, clearly here we have a new surpassing, there it leaves us a breakout high, therefore point validated. Is there any smaller retracement that I validated behind? No, it's correct, point validated, and I go to the new high, there it is, we have new high. The price has to break above that level, false breakout, you fall, we change the validation point, we change, you are already surpassing the previous point of control, if you validate above that level there will be evolution, the price makes a new here, this would be the lowest point, it is the only point that I can validate, we measure that height, from the maximum of the fractal, 273 pips, 273 divided by 3, 91, you had to surpass 91 pips, yes, yes, yes, bam, look, to the next high, two closed candles to the right from that peak point. Is there any lesser retracement before a lesser degree? Yes, gone, dead, evolution of fractality, we are deriving the real evolved movements from the graph, there, let's measure, how much did this have?, about 270, how much does the previous one have?, we measure, 300, this is greater than this, therefore both remain valid, and we continue, retracement, we start again, you have to surpass above that level, with that height, clearly, you break it, and you come here to make the first high after the breakout, point validated, Is there any smaller retracement than this behind? No, it is correct, and we go to the next retracement, we do the same, you have to surpass, you clearly break it, I go to the next high, point validated, Are there any smaller retracement behind? We measure, 79 pips, 72 pips, broken point, dead point, it's over, this is the real movement, I always have to know what the real movements are, this is trading kindergarten stuff, gentlemen, this would be the first lesson any person entering trading should receive, to know how to remove the noise of movements that are dead and to always be working with important control points and important evolved fractals of the asset being worked on, we continue, here you make high, perfect, I already have to make the same story, you keep generating depth, depth, depth, we have to measure that height, we measure, up to there you have 205 pips, I don't complicate, 205 divided by 3, 68 pips, we measure, from that high you had to break 68 pips, clearly, we go to the first high, after the breakout, validated point, Are there any smaller retracements behind? Yes, therefore, gone, here is evolution, that retracement is worthless, they took it away, these are the real movements of that rise, everything else is noise, look, we should never take anything, neither from there, nor from there, nor from there, noise, noise, noise, noise, noise, noise, the real movements in that rise are those, constant evolution, constant fractality, minor movements lead to major movements, major movements make minor movements obsolete, control points, we could only look for reasons to trace cycles, either from this, or from this, or from this, and of course always from the origin, therefore I could only be looking for cycles, either from there, or from there, or from there, or from there, any cycle I drew from a fractal that is dead, from a minimum of any previous fractal that is already dead, would be wrong, any area that gave me work a fib from an incorrect starting point, that was not a correct control point in the movement sequence, or from the origin, would be worthless, it would be wrong, any area would be wrong, therefore we must differentiate them very well.",

      "translation": "It is very important to understand one thing. When we were in the first fractal or in any of the fractals, when we were in this sideways movement and we didn't know if the price would break up or down, the moment the price actually breaks in the same direction as the impulse of the previous fractal, in this case, the low or high, if it were a bearish case, which the price leaves us, that lowest or highest point, if it were a bearish case, that highest point that the retracement of the fractality leaves us, we call these control points. These control points will be extremely important for us. We will detail them more later. The correct fractality point that remains when the price breaks, in this case, the minimum that was originated by the previous fractality or the maximum that originated the previous fractality. These control points will be explained in detail because, together with the origins of movements, they are the most important points of any sequence, whether bullish or bearish. We’ll detail them much better. But of course, here we face another problem. What is the problem? Look, when I developed all these concepts I tried to make everything as objective as possible. That there would be no doubts about the things we are working on, the concepts I teach you, they couldn't have any kind of subjectivity, but I acknowledge that some things have been very difficult, such as the concept of a break. When I am in this sideways movement, how much does the price have to exceed that previous maximum to say that there really is a break? How long should it stay out? How do we measure whether the break is made or not? It would happen the same here below. How much must the price pass that level to say I have a break either above or below? This is a very subjective concept. No one agrees on this. Some people, the big gurus say that with a pip, with a point that exceeds that level or with a point or a pip that passes this level, the break can already be considered done. But I disagree. And I am going to define very clearly at what moment we will consider that this is a correct break. For example, in this case, we would say that the impulse of the next fractal has already started, we have to have the concept very, very, very clear. Look, when people are looking at this, when people are looking at this fractal, people do not realize they are working in a lateral movement. People are thinking that if the price comes and surpasses that level, I will buy. If the price comes and surpasses this level, I will sell. This is what the public is thinking. The vast majority because in the tests I did with students, this is what they have told me. We are doing this with a simple fractal. If the price exceeds that level, the public will buy. If the price exceeds this level, the public will sell. Therefore, can I say that is a break? The answer is no. Why not? Because there's a magical word called counterpart. If everyone here is going to buy and if I know that everyone here is going to sell, the institutional knows it too. And it means that in each of our fractals there are two zones where the price can be manipulated because they can find the counterpart they need. They know perfectly what the public will do in each fractal. One after another, one after another, one after another, they know. If I were institutional, I know that everyone there will buy. Therefore, I would have the option to sell there because I will find sufficient counterpart. And here, the opposite. If we apply this to the concept of a break, under no circumstances am I going to apply a PIP. If I know they do it in zones, how am I going to consider that a single PIP is enough? Therefore, we will set fundamental rules. We will say that there is an exceedance and therefore a valid control point because the impulse of the next fractal has already been formed, only if the price exceeds that level with at least one third of the height of the retracement that has formed. In this case, the height of this retracement is this. For me to say that there is a break you have had to exceed one third of this height. I’m putting it here for you to see. This is so simple when we are in a chart as to measure that in PIPs, divide by three and from that point, from the maximum that originated the retracement, it should have exceeded at least a third part of that height. Therefore, while you do not exceed that height, I do not say that we have a correct control point here, and therefore we have a correct break and therefore we have initiated the impulse of the next fractal. If you do this, it’s not possible for you to go back in. I remain the same, still in the same sideways. The price can fall. I remain in the same sideways, I will only validate as a control point the lowest point of the sideways and the price may try again. You have to always surpass the point that originated the retracement never take false breaks, you will have a thousand false breaks. I only validate the lowest point, that point is worthless it is false it is manipulation no, I keep sideways still the same and if you do this you have to break a third, and it is possible to make another false break, I still validate the lowest point if you make a lower point that would not be the point I should validate if this now goes up we have a new possible point of validation, the lowest and therefore the height has changed no longer the same number of pips or points that you now have to validate because the degree of the retracement has changed now you have to exceed that new height that no longer counts you will be crushed with slow retracements they will crush you with false breaks over and over and over and over you will have to master this perfectly and we will do it I will always need you to understand the concept first so that later when applying it in practice is easier so always concept first if this goes back again, it's not still the same point you have to break, do not take false breaks they will fool you, your sight will deceive you concept over and over again concept is that the height that is the point that originated all this sideways we remain sideways but with false breaks over and over over only when the price does there can I say that this control point is now correct and that the impulse of the next fractal has been initiated that at some point will give me a new retracement and therefore a new sideways only there all this was a slow retracement with false breaks constant constant constant we have to master this aspect we have to understand that the only valid correct point within these continuous laterals which leave us thousands of points that will confuse us is only correct the lowest point or the highest point in the bearish case for us to use it for any possible analysis we will also use them a lot they are fundamental points everything I could take from here is wrong and what I take from here is wrong always the lowest point always a correct validation control points beware of false breaks that deceive the public because the public buys as soon as the price breaks they deceive you they re-enter positions they deceive you again they re-enter positions and when they have everything in they generate the new impulse we will have to master this perfectly seen in concept I know it's a bit boring without a doubt the next thing we will have to see is in chart, right? we have to fully control these control points we leave it here review this video as many times as necessary because they are very important aspects from all this that we have seen in this video will come out the rest this is or this is the fundamental basis the understanding of why things happen in a chart the thinking like an institutional never like a small investor understanding that everything is premeditated everything is absolutely calculated that they want our money and they will do whatever is necessary to make us leave our accounts they know the public works with very simple very basic rules they know that the public always works the same and they will take advantage we will never work like the masses",

      "translation": "If there's a concept or phrase or number that's overwhelmingly talked about, the one you're most likely to hear about, and undoubtedly the one that's most important to people, without a doubt, it's the accuracy percentage. This number or concept is one of the most concerning to people. Not only when I talk to you individually, the accuracy percentage is tremendously important to you all, but I assume that when you're in a chat, have been at an event, or have been with other investors, without a doubt, this is one of the most important concepts. Do you agree with what I just said? When I meet people of this type, I always reflect the same thing. When you talk about accuracy percentage, you forget it's 100% connected to something called failure. 100% related. You cannot talk about success without talking about failure. People talk about accuracy percentage in isolation. It doesn't serve me that you talk to me about accuracy percentage alone. Only about accuracy percentage doesn't serve me. If I apply common sense, I say to myself only failure is going to destroy me. It's that simple. In other words, when I talk with people about my trading, about my operations, people who are very curious, when I go to an event and they meet me and people come and ask me and such, of course, the usual, right? They get to know you, they come, they ask about your operations, what's the accuracy percentage. They always ask the same questions, but no one asks me about the failure percentage. They ask me about execution, those entries that catch the turn, what's your accuracy percentage, and how much do you risk per operation. They ask all kinds of questions, but no one asks me about failure. No one. It has always caught my attention. Always. How is it possible? 200,000 numbers, 200,000 concepts, like the control point, how you get the cycle, the work of the area, I don't know what pattern and how you enter this pattern, no one asks me about this. When the first question I would ask, imagine that I go to the City of London and, for whatever reason, I meet some investors. Imagine that these investors are working at the best investment fund in all of London and I have the ability and chance to meet them and moreover, have the capacity and chance to talk to them about trading. The bloody first question I'd ask them is what's your failure percentage and how do you manage it? I only want to know how you make money managing failure. Look at what I'm telling you. Why? Because if I know how you handle failure and win, that's what I must value from you, that's what I would value from that person. I wouldn’t ask you anything about your methodology at all, but if you teach me how you manage your failure and if you show me a better way than I do to manage failure, I'd leave there learning a hell of a lot. What do you think about what I'm telling you? Strange? Am I such a weirdo? Now put yourselves in the situation. Do you know that operator from the City? Let's imagine any powerful investment fund, any insurance company, any bank, or any institution. Imagine he's a crack and that his business is highly profitable, and he's the one who controls all of this. The last thing you'd ask him is this. Moreover, you wouldn't even ask him. Do you see the different way of how you see it compared to how I see it? Because I know that successful trader, the secret of his success is in how he manages failure. I know it and he knows it, but you wouldn't be going there thinking like this. Most of you would be thinking, damn, what's your method on the chart? How do you enter? How do you analyze? What's your method? I couldn't care less about his method, but how he manages his loss would be gold to me. Before, I was asked, and how should the mindset think?

      "translation": "Good afternoon, good morning. Hello, I'm Joaquín Vega, Monday, March 16. I'm going to show you a setup I've been eager to start, involving crude oil on a 5-minute chart. We were hoping, based on our long-term charts, for the price to retest these levels around $28.2. We're talking about Texas oil. It's a very important zone where, as long as the price doesn't reach the level of $27.36, if the price reaches this level, we could see much more significant falls, even down to levels of $21.90. But, I insist, as long as that doesn't happen, we are in a zone and at a perfect timing to start long positions. One of the possibilities the map we are working with offers is for a very good upward retracement. Notice that we've come to a 5-minute timeframe to find the right timing for entry, but the main map, and I insist again, as long as the price doesn't reach those levels of $27.36, we might see a very significant upward movement. In fact, as you can see here, this would be the potential path for that rise. There you have it. Up to those levels of $71. It's true that the price will encounter two very important levels. In fact, we're going to take a partial from these three positions we have. We're going to take one out, as a partial, with an upward move of about $9, levels around $38 per barrel, $38.70, there we might see new downward turns. We'll take a second final partial, also as a partial, so that the price could climb about $21.5 to reach levels of $50.88 a barrel. And the final target, as I said, would be for the price to reach those $71 levels. Therefore, we are in a very critical zone within the higher maps, in the sense that we could have a very significant upward bounce. Clearly, the price is just starting the move, but we are planning the possibility of entering here from previous levels, like those. Here, long positions were already being entered, this is the interpretation we are making. This is a zone where the institutions are placing very long positions, and we think this level is the last level where they will place their final positions, and from here we will see a significant turn. Logically, we are at the opening, and there is much ahead, but we stick with that first level, those levels of $38.70 as an important initial rise level. We should start to see almost a $10 rise from there, and from there we can start to think that a good rebound of Texas oil is indeed ahead. We'll wait and see if it's true, let's see what happens. Alright, we continue with the movement, it's very important that it surpasses these levels. Surpassing it somehow strongly, something like this. If it wants it to support and go from there. So far so good. I'll also show you DAX. Look, I talked about timing. Timing, as I've said many times, is always important in any setup with or without volatility, but with volatility, I insist again, it is much more important. Ratios can go through the roof. I'm able to sacrifice, as in this case, two failed previous entries. I don't care if I'm within an important zone where I have information that the map indicates it can be significant. I don't mind sacrificing one, two, three trades if I end up getting that perfect timing. These trades are simply managed, and that's it. But timing with volatility is pure gold. I'm going to take some partials. I'm waiting for the SP500, here you have it. We are also buying. I'm waiting for the price to finally reach these levels. It's almost there to take a partial of 167 points. Right now we have about 140. Let's take a partial here with 140 points, let's take a bit of profit, and the rest we let run to those levels of 2,912. We're looking for a total target of around 480-490 points to those levels. And, of course, on the DAX, following correlation, instead of taking the partial, since it's gone slower than I thought, we'll take a partial now. We're talking about 600 points. We'll also take a partial now. We'll take a little less. I'm not going to take the partial here, although it's a possible rebound zone. We'll stick with 600 instead of 1,000. But I will go for a final target at those levels of 10,275. So that's 1,930 points. We'll see how these behave then. Possibility of rebound. We'll see if it's just a rebound and continue or break down. The DAX always depends on the SP. And oil. We'll see how they behave at that important level. We'll wait a bit more to see how they behave. Well, to wrap up the video. As you see, oil, deep retracement. Normal. We go to SP too. We've got a retracement. And in the DAX, I've just placed the last position of the day. There you have it. Very specific target path. 400 points to those levels of 9,090, 9,095. I'll be paying attention at the end of the session to see where it stands. And not much more. As said, the timing. Timing gives us a huge possibility of having very powerful ratios. The more confirmations we put on our entries, they will surely be more reliable. But it also weighs on having worse ratios. So each one decides. Let's see how these three trades evolve. We already have some partials taken. So nothing more. Regards.",

      "translation": "Based on this story, I'm going to leave it here a bit marked, let's see what it does. Based on this, well, in the DAX, right? The DAX in its map was reaching that high part. An area of indecision also very important within its own map. Very important since we were working on a decline and we were working on that retracement with a fairly wide area of indecision. Before, to make you realize, we are in a pattern 2 of a huge area, therefore, before the price got here and confirmed pattern 3, we could be trying those sales, as for example at this imbalance level. Therefore, seeing what was on SP, we could perfectly make some kind of attempt on the DAX. Short positions there, in the first retracements short positions here. There are minimum failures, we return to the reading, there are minimum failures, I know it can continue to rise because this is a pattern 2 within your map and as always, now it depends on what the SP does, you will fall or continue to rise. There is not much more to say. In principle, you are making minimums, you are making minimums, but what really interests me right now, for me to see that bearish force is really coming in here, you already know what it is, we say fractality in favor, you are already doing it, it is the first relevant thing you have to do to think that it can go well. There are two conditions, one is this, well, you are doing it well, it is the less important, but it is the first and then the second is that you start breaking relevant levels. Relevant levels in that previous movement, the first relevant level is this. What happens? That from this relevant level, if it's a relevant level, it's possible that it is a point of control. Logically, that point of control will give me a cycle, therefore, a great thing you should do to break this relevant level would be to break this cycle. If you go and break this cycle, that is, if you reach the extension below, here you are already telling me that you are behaving well. These would be the, and I'm going to insert a wedge here, look, anyone who was working with trends in this movement would be doing this and would be doing this. Surely. Many, I'm throwing it out there, many who were working with trends see that the accelerated one starts to break. I don’t care if it breaks. I can work with trends without drawing trends. Why? Because I know that out of all this upward movement, the last relevant point of control is this. Therefore, I don’t even need this trend line, nor this trend line. I know that the trend will be broken when the price comes here, when it breaks that last upward cycle. We are not working with trends, but to show you a little bit how simple it is to observe when a trend can be considered broken, when it breaks the last cycle of the last relevant point of control of a movement. That's why for me to have pure conviction that this is going well, it’s essential that you fall through these levels. Does that mean that after here you will continue falling? No. Here perfectly, you can support here and come to make a retracement. Perfectly.",

Give me ideas, add positions in favor, you do it straightforwardly, but when the price is here and the reasoning that the chart is telling us is absolutely clear and simple and it’s saying this doesn’t look good, removing positions is very hard for you, you don’t usually remove them as the price is ruining your position, that is, as the price goes on doing this, you don’t usually remove, and that’s a very serious mistake in fractional entry, if you don’t master this well, you will never master fractional entry well, but in this case, I'm not going to do it, why not? what you’ve said is the usual thing I do, yes, I have excitement for adding but also I have excitement for removing, normally that’s what I do, but why in this case am I not going to do it? why? of course yes, Pedro, of course yes, Juan, guys, I’m going long, if I wasn’t going long there’s nothing to talk about, I would already be removing, I would have taken a couple or three for sure, but I'm going long, the power of hedging, I'm not only buying but the long position is winning by two partials and those two positions there aren’t meant to make money, so notice the magic of hedge, which is why I love them, if now this takes me out, I stay the same, everything you take from me here for taking the seven positions I already took from you here and here, but look, in addition, I still have two long, what do I care right now? that this does like this, those seven positions are free, like those seven positions, the possible stops are paid by another that I already got from the other one before with these two, I'll keep giving you the opportunity to fall with seven, does this make sense or am I crazy? and now comes a bit of what you say Jesús, if it threw you out above, would you take out a buy and leave the other? what a good question, absolutely, what happens? now that I'm seeing things bad, these two longs don’t have objectives because they aren’t meant to make money, they’re meant to cover exactly this option that it takes those seven positions from me, what happens if in addition I now take this profit and say, look, if you take the stops you will also take a position, you will take a long and I keep another one that will keep covering the possible shorts that I can keep doing above and now seeing this I ask, understanding that I already took two partials from the long, understanding that the position might do like this and understanding that I just placed a profit on one of them here where the stops start to jump, my question is, if this does like this, do I still make money? we’ve messed up, I’m free, do you know that I’m working free? that the party is paid by someone else? back again to the same percent garbage, yes, that if this jumps it will mark my statistics seven stops, sure, my percentage loss is huge, sure, but do I still make money? yes, I have the option for you to fall, look at that, and I’m going with the option for you to fall with seven, at the end, once again and put it in your head, it’s all numbers, what worries me about this situation and that’s why I have the stops there, they aren’t placed capriciously, is if it goes to look for the 200, see where the 200 is? I might even put it a bit higher, this is the fear I have that it still does this, pinches a bit and falls, this can happen perfectly, let's suppose it falls, let's assume that well, hey, it retraces a bit more, good, but ultimately decides to fall, this also has to be thought of now, all of this has to be thought of now, one of the positions at least or two, I would let run a lot, why? because the potential runs with these movements are huge, okay, here there is a 38 activation level of a cycle that comes from below, from a point of control that comes from below and also with liquidity here underneath a lot, here we have to think of everything, if this now falls without taking out the stops, I’m renouncing the gain of two, that is, the gain from those two, which right now, I will lose, it wouldn’t make much sense for me not to put two here, that is, those two I'm going to stop gaining, I take them with two sell positions, if I had one, I would put one, if I had three, I would put three, if I have two, I put two, this level is a level where, it’s not a level, it’s an area, it’s an area where there will very possibly be a bounce, two are taken out there, okay, so we have three left, we’ve said two go out here, two stay, three, well, easy, expand map, go to the next control point, trace, there we have the next 38, one of them will go here and one more, let’s suppose it falls, I don’t know if it's going to fall or not, but if it does, I know I have this here, let’s position ourselves, let’s mark, let’s see how this looks, so I can play with my mind on how to do it, okay,",

      "translation": "I get the feeling that you don't understand what they are for, what virtue I see in hedging. I don't know, let's make up an example. I'm working here in a buy zone, here I find an opposite sell zone, I'm making up a map and I realize that I have a larger zone here. Here I find a sell zone, here I find an intermediate sell zone, and I am working here. Let's see, the price has come from wherever it has, I am here in buys. Perfect, I go long. Let's suppose that in this example, there's another larger zone above. I'm making up a map. Keep the fictitious map in mind. The price comes here, so I see that my map, if I attack this zone and this is the farthest zone on my map, I understand that when I am operating here, the potential move is this. So, if I am executing here, I don't know if it will make the potential move or not; I have no idea. But I always tell you one thing, when I talk about hedging, this is implicit, it is implicit because if not, it would not make sense, which is that I go with several positions. When I say several positions, I mean at least two. It can be three, four, five, or six, but at least two. Look, when I do this, I'll tell you why I do it, so you can understand why I use it. Now another thing is the interpretation you will make of it. Look, one of these positions that I place here, I will let it run up to here, for sure. I observe this distance, let's assume that here there are, I don't know, 400 pips. Okay, I hold them, perfect. Then I locate that this distance suits me, in terms of endurance. I already have it clear that if I put a position, it will consist of several shots, therefore one will go up to there, for sure. Okay, what's the problem? That when I am like this and carry here two or three positions, I don't know if it will arrive or not. Why? Well, because it can reverse here, this can fall from here, this can fall from here, I don't know what it will do. So, I will use the hedge just in case it doesn't want to make that move. I always tell you, I don't want to be right, I want to make money. The only way not to want to be right and make money is to go with the price whether it rises or falls. I don't want to be right, I just want that if the price rises, I want to go with it. If the price falls, I want to go with it. I don't care about the direction, they pay me the same. Whether I buy or sell, they pay me the same. So, I have no priority regarding whether the price rises or falls. Dual thinking, always, constant. If you understand this story that is so simple, you will do better by not getting bogged down with one direction. I don't care, to rise, to fall. Alright. So, of course, I am attacking here because I have a reason to buy. Let's imagine it is the start of a possible hedge. There always has to be a position 1. This is position 1. If I now want to hedge there will be a position 2 which will be the opposite. Sales. Good. The question is, if I know that the price can make this move and fall, or make this move and fall, I don't care about making money with this rise, up to the yellow. I don't care to earn that, to take this, or to take this. It’s all the same to me. Do it the way you have to do it. I have a map that tells me that from here it can turn around, and I additionally have another opposite zone that also tells me that it can turn around. It’s all the same to me. What happens then? In my mind, I already think, I will leave one up to the yellow. At least one up to the potential move, because I've controlled the distance, and it suits me, I can endure it. But I will also try to play the card that you might do this or this in these two places. I don’t wed the white zone. I’ve only entered you because it’s the place to enter and period. It’s a buy zone; if you do what I wanted, I’ll buy from you. If you come to the brown zone, it’s all the same to me. If you reach the zone, you do what I want, I’ll sell you. If you get to the purple, if you reach and do what I want, I’ll sell you too. I don’t wed any. I’m indifferent to all. It’s all the same to me, one or another. Total indifference. Since I have this mindset of total indifference, and since I have so little attachment to the zones, because I understand that any of them can be good and any of them can fail, if I’ve already taken one of the moves, one, in this case, an upward move, from now on my thought is, okay, whether you rise or fall, I want to be inside. So, what do I do? The approach is obvious. What is the first critical zone? Initially, what does this fictitious map have? The brown one. Perfect. If here I've decided to put an opposite position, it’s the first relevant zone. I’m not going to be so stupid to be left with nothing from this piece, because then, it would be completely ridiculous for this price to come here, I put an opposite position, and what I've earned here I lose. This is ridiculous. This is a bad hedge. This is crap. Ensuring money whether it rises or falls by securing a gain, at least partial, in each movement. That is, if I have it clear that I will attack you here in sales, if you do what you should, I will get one here. Therefore, if I already have gains here, and here I’ve already taken X money, I don’t care, I add, if I get gains here, now only two things can happen, either you keep rising or you fall. No more story. When reaching this point, here where I already have gains, and now that I’m going to put it, let's assume that it also does what I want it to do, and I'm inside. I gain in all ways, but watch out, I don’t gain in all ways. You know it has certain peculiarities. If I have two left here, I will go with two here. And I always, in the second position, in the opposite second, I put one more. That is, I put what is left from the first one, plus one more. That is, if I had entered with three, I took out one here, I’m left with two. Okay, so if I enter the hedge, I will enter with three. Why? If it decides to fall, because it actually wants to do this, one of them, at the same place where I have these, I will take a gain again. Therefore, I have the gain from that small rise, and I have the gain from the fall. These will get taken out, but I stay inside. Therefore, I already won here, and I am winning here. I am ready for you to do this. I don’t care. Go wherever you want. If I put the hedge here and you fail, because you decide to keep rising, you will take these out. These three that I just placed here are paid with this gain. These losses are paid with this gain. And I continue to await, winning with two. From these two, another will come out here. At some point, it may turn around. Here, if you do what you should, I will sell you too. Therefore, I have one left here. This one is the one that will go to the yellow. That I’m already forgetting about, I have nothing else to do with it. It will be in break even; if you reach the yellow, great, and if not, take me out. Why? Because I will do the same to you. Now, in this case, I will put in the hedge, I will put two. You do what you should, no idea, whatnot, pipes, flutes. Now I go with one that I have left, plus another. Why? If you keep rising, I have this gain and this gain. These are still paid, and I keep winning with one. Decide to rise if you want. I keep winning. Or instead, fall. Look, it won’t reach the yellow; it will do this. Don’t worry. This one I placed here, goes out here. Therefore, I win here. And now, as I am left with none, because this one got taken out, I am already out of the hedge. Now I only go sales. I am already out of the hedge. There came a time when the hedge dissolves itself. But of course, in this movement, in this I did here, I won this move, I won this move with another. First this, then this, plus then this. Now the price is here. It already seems that it can keep falling. I stay inside with one. This is a hedge. I want to go with you. There is a moment when the hedge dissolves because you release from the initial position. You release, taking partials, pieces. And logically, there comes a time when only, for example, in this case, you are left with the sale. Now from here I’m already pending to put another hedge to cover this, to cover the possibility that the price now wants to go up. I insist, I don’t care if you rise or fall, if I just want to go with you, even if you don’t want to reach the final targets, even if you don’t get here, I’m adding you. I’m catching you. Bam. I’m catching you. Bam. I’m catching you. Bam. I think that, under all concepts, it prevents my account from falling. And no matter how bad my targets do not arrive, I keep adding little by little, little by little, until my good winning trade comes. Little by little, little by little, little by little. This is a hedge. This is what I use a hedge for. To detach from any zone. To detach from any direction. It’s all the same to me to sell or buy. I just want to be. It helps me a lot to keep the curve stable. That it doesn’t fall. To keep increasing little by little. To detach from the direction. Moreover, I tell you more, look. When I am in a hedge, when I am bought and sold, it is the absolute feeling of... Because I’ve caught you.",

      "translation": "I haven't talked to you about patterns at all. I'm asking you how you will distribute your operations. Because if you don't know how many trades you're going to do inside or outside, you have a problem. This doesn't depend on the price, it depends on me. I already know how many trades I'll do in each one of them before I get in. I'm not looking for a reason, I'm just telling you, of those three trades I have and based on the type of zones the price will attack, in this case this zone that has 28 and 42, I can tell you which I work here and which I work there. The only way to have control is to never let the price condition you. Never. You command, you distribute, you do the numbers, you do everything. The price will just move up or down. Nothing more. But everything else you have to know before it happens. One thing is the reason you execute, and another is how you distribute inside or outside. You can't give to everything because you'll break. You must have execution criteria more than defined. And this defined execution criteria first goes by knowing how many trades you'll do here, in this zone. Both inside and outside. Whatever happens. Basically what I'm trying to explain to you is the following. You and I have a problem. You and I, I'm included, have a huge problem you have to be super aware of. You have shitty numbers. You and I. Where are you going with three trades a day? And where are you going with 38 pips per stop? Are you aware? I'm including myself as well. If you are aware of the shitty numbers you have because you don't have the capacity for more. Because we have a shitty account. You and I have a shitty account. I don't care if you have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand. We are absolutely limited. Both in stop sizes and in number of trades. That's what's happening. What do I mean with this? I mean that those few resources you have, you and I with 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand euros, we are the fucking ridiculous. That's why this happens to us. Therefore, we have to be smart when handling these few resources. Very smart. Why? Because if not, the market will crush us. What do I mean by this? That you can't give everything. You have to be a fucking sniper because you don't have a choice. You don't have a machine gun. You don't have the capacity you would have with half a million. No, sorry. Machine guns are not for you and not for me. You go bullet by bullet and listen, you have three. It's not about what you hunt. It's about the bullet you shoot that doesn't come back. You have to be much more selective. Much more selective. What am I trying to convey to you? If I have three shots. What's easier? Covering both inside and outside or covering just outside or just inside? You have to be aware of your enormous limitation. I know it can go one way or the other. Yes, I know. I'm aware. But dude, I have to understand my limitation. I'll tell you my case. My case. But my case doesn't mean it's what you have to do because I have people who do the opposite and it works for them. That is to say, I decide to always work outside. I decide to work all my zones outside. It's easier to work in a unique outside division than inside outside. Now, what happens with this? Of course, it can make sense. Of course, it makes sense. All my shots I take outside and to hell with it. That way I concentrate better what little I have. Okay, but it has a serious problem. Every time the price comes inside and leaves, this is not for you. Now, that it's not for you is easy to understand, but you have to assume it. And here's the problem. And here's where the problem comes in. But beware, it's not a trading problem. It's a problem in the trader's head. How angry it makes me. There's no anger in trading. There is what there is. Common sense and numbers. There's nothing else. You can say, Joaquín, I'd rather split it all inside. I tell you, it's just as fine. If the zone fails and it comes outside, you fail. Same as I do when working outside and it falls from inside. It's called discipline. I want my trades, not all trades. I don't have the capacity. And when I tell you to decide this, I decide now, before anything happens. I'm not conditioned by the shitty price. I'm not conditioned by what I can't control. I decide how I distribute. I decide if I work outside. I decide with how many trades, with what stops. I decide everything. Now, don't ask me to control that price because it's impossible. But even so, that which is impossible to control is what ends up conditioning you. You won't control it. You have to control everything within your possibility to control. That's first, not losing more than I say I'm going to lose. But I also tell you, that's the easiest. But what about winning? And distributing your operation? It's all important. It's a whole. You can't stick to just one thing. Because each thing has its importance. This is a whole. Students who lose well, their account doesn't drop. But it doesn't go up at all. If you have it clear that your account doesn't drop, that you know how to lose, you need to enhance the other. Then, one of the fundamental parts is this. I execute always the same, I understand my limitation and I commit to always doing exactly my operations in these places. Not in others. Whatever the price does. I'm not interested in anything other than what I want. This is essential. That's why I say, when the price is going to enter a zone, I already know what I'm going to do. Whatever it does. Do you understand that I disregard that price? That I have control? I understand that it will elude me many times. And I also tell you something. When I explain this to you, the typical question is what is better, inside or outside? You ask the wrong question. I always say the same thing. You're asking the wrong question. Why? Because I can assure you something. Whatever you choose. As a fundamental choice of your operation, inside or outside. Whatever you choose. This will go in seasons. Sometimes the inside ones will constantly work and you're waiting outside like an idiot. And sometimes the outside ones will constantly work and the inside ones will constantly fail. This isn't about which is better. It's about which one you feel better with, disregarding the other completely. That's the thing. Neither is better. It goes in seasons. But you marry one and center your operation on one. Come what may and whatever happens. And if you're two weeks without any going outside, too bad. Don't worry, your two weeks where all go outside will come. Don't worry. So, this is the mental support you have to establish. This is what I say I'm going to do and this is what I do. I understand what's going to happen. The one I disregard will act many times. But you understand, and this is the phrase I always say, I only want mine. I don't want someone else's. This, that seems so simple to say, isn't easy to do. Why? Because what you call anger comes in. I'm never angry. I simply say, that's not mine.",

Of course, I have coverage. I'm still with two from below, and I've set the target for one of them right when the stops are triggered. That's why the account will grow. It's possible that I'll be taken out. Look at the loss levels I have in those positions that are there. Do you see the amount of loss? But if you look at oil, each of the ones I have down there is gaining over 300. So here, as it is an important first attempt where I'm putting in everything, it's a good place to set a new upward target. That means it will take out eight positions and one from below. And that will make this grow. The coverage is brutal, man. Let's see if it happens. So you realize the power this has. Watch. If they are triggered, the account will increase. And if it respects it now and falls, I'll go with eight. I'm going with eight. So, do you think I'm worried about what it will do? If it rises and triggers, I win.

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Good morning, good afternoon. Hello, I'm Joaquín Vega. Monday, December 5th. Today I want to talk to you about a concept many of you ask me about, which is called hedging, a concept I use. Everyone has their idea of what hedging is. I'll try to explain in a simple way, let's say, with a practical example of how I use hedging. Look, it all starts with the idea that there is an origin of movement. An origin of movement that, logically, we try to capture and that has a potential range, as was the case in our recent videos with the S&P 500, where we've been entering long positions from these levels. When I carry out this operation, the chart suggests there is potential to rise to those levels. Perfect. Therefore, I begin the trade with multiple positions, two, three, four positions. When I initiate this movement, I already know that at this potential target we could start contrary positions. That means we're buying. At that level, I take profits because we're trying to introduce contrary positions. What does this mean? It means that from these positions, two, three, four positions, I will take different levels of partials as targets, and one of them will also serve as a final target at that level where I will try to enter short, contrary positions. But one of them, at least one, I will always maintain because I assume it's lost, relatively speaking. What does it mean that I assume it's lost? It means that if I'm here trying to enter short positions, contrary to the long position, logically, I might be wrong. If this area indeed fails and the price continues to rise, I keep earning from the position I have in the original movement. On the other hand, if in these short positions, just like we introduced here, with this group of positions, if the price indeed falls, I consider this operation lost. Right now, we're trying to start a new downtrend movement, which in this case has potential to fall to 3,770. Well, if the price falls, it will take away the last long position I have here, but logically, when the price falls, I will take profits from the contrary positions. Therefore, when the price reaches this level, having taken different levels of partials, including the final movement until there, if the price continues upwards, I keep gaining, and if it falls, I forsake the remaining long position, but take profits from the short position. Therefore, in this margin where I'm hedging, it's a win-win. Understand? It's a win-win. If the price proves me right, I win either way. I don't mind profiting from the long position or the short one. This is the general idea, very briefly, of what I manage with hedging. If we see what's happening now, I keep one of the positions from this origin of movement, and we're bringing in six positions. I'll take this opportunity to tell you what I'm expecting here. We're going to take three of the positions we currently have as partials, around those levels of 3950-55. These positions are going to serve as partials, just as we did with the long movement. They're going to serve as partials. Notice how I'm positioning that group of partials. There they are. The price might fall a little more to those levels of 3895, to take out all the stops underneath and seek, as we've discussed in previous videos, liquidity. We could have a direct move to 3895 or a pause in this partial level to go up and then down again. Ultimately, this is the general picture I'm expecting. In the kit, around 3895 there might be a high rebound possibility, but the final target, as you see, two of them will remain at those targets of 3780 because I'm going to attempt long positions there once again playing with the concept of hedging. If the price falls here and gives me these partial and final targets, here I'll try to enter long positions, maintaining one short position, therefore if the price keeps falling it'll take me out of the long positions, but I'll continue profiting from the short position. It's a way to seek win or win. Of course, the price has to give me the movement, alright? Let's wait and see if we can take those first partial levels. Well, folks, I've raised those initial levels a bit higher because this is a rebound area, it's a bit broad. Let's aim for an average decline of those three positions of around 100 points, and from here, with high probability, before the price breaks the stops below, we might have this movement. Let's see if it's true. What we're going to do is keep the three initial positions, those two targets, and we'll also leave one as a hedge for the buying possibilities we'll make below. Well, I always tell you it's a very useful tool, a very useful concept and one of the concepts I always tell you is why I like CFDs a bit, as I've mentioned many times. By the way, before ending the video, do you see any kind of cachopo for you in this turn? Nothing more, regards.",

Juanjo is also resetting the maps to minor timeframes. Good. Victor, numbers on paper, correcting things, that's fine. I need to filter better, okay, we are correcting, no problem. The point is to correct what we do wrong, right? Well, what is happening here? What do we have to do today, gentlemen? Last week the market was crazy. What are we doing today? Closing profits? Well, we are going to close profits. We are floating a lot. We have to close, alright, let's do it. Let's see what I have in progress in each one of them. First, let's close and then we'll see a little bit of what's there, alright? Alright, let's go with S&P 500. We talked about the process the price was doing in the last session. Right now I am with five positions. Let's start closing, notice I have five buys, four sells, let's balance this a bit by leaving the hedge open but let's start taking profits. We have an excessive amount of things, let's close these two, close profits, close profits, notice now I have three down, three buys, four sells, we are still unbalanced. What we are going to do is, I close a bit of sell with one, now we are 3 and 3 and we are going to leave 2 and 2 alright, and here we already take floating. Now we will see how the account looks in total. I am holding here, I will adjust stops a bit on the latest ones, now we will see this a little calmly, perfect, we maintain hedging. Now we will see a little bit what I am expecting here. We go to Nasdaq, same reasons as in the S&P, bought, same reasons as in the S&P, sold, we are with hedging, we are disproportionately high, we carry two down we have 1, 2, 3, 4, let's close 2 and maintain hedging with 2 and 2, okay. Also, if we see this a bit now, therefore here we are already improved in floating and we are still maintaining hedging. We go to Euro, I've been sold with one for a long time, I have bought with 3, we are unbalanced. Let's take two purchases earnings out, we take two purchase earnings, maintain hedging, okay, sell buy. We go to DAX, bought two positions, sold two positions, let's take one and one out, even here we could take them all out because we maintain hedging in S&P and DAX, so I don't complicate life. We close everything and work indices with S&P DAX, keep it clean, outside of LAX. We go to gold, still hold two long positions, very long, I don't go with hedging, let's close one and we go lastly to GBP/USD, I hold one position, one position that here I will leave open, alright. If we balance what we have left, we have improved a lot the floating, is the floating execution correct or do I have your blessing Juanjo? Damn, Juanjo, how many positions do you have? Mine plus oil.

      "translation": "Good morning, good afternoon. Hello, I am Joaquín Vega, Monday, April 25th. Working on SP500, hourly chart, we find the price in a very important decision zone around the levels of 4,200 points. We start with the first of at least three long positions that I want to enter to look for the targets you see there. We start entering positions, we start placing stops. As the price continues to validate my premise, we will add at least two more positions. First partial levels, levels at 4,390 points. Final objectives, levels at 4,575, 80 points. We expect the price to validate us. A lot of buying power should enter, therefore, the movement should be relatively quick. This would give us options to add two or three more positions. We wait and execute. Okay, we have the perfect situation, four positions. We start placing target levels. First partial levels, levels at 4,385, a rise of around 170 points, and we will exit with two of the positions as a partial. We continue with a third one looking for an upward target of around 360 points, levels at 4,567, and we'll let one position run up to higher levels. Today's tip, always try to work in zones, always try to work with divided positions, that is, if we want to enter a position, structure it in two, three, four entries, and as the price continues to validate us, we add gradually until completing the full entry. I always use this same technique. Never add positions when we have an existing position going against us. Always add when with positions in our favor. There should be a clear entry of money, a very powerful initial movement. Let's see if we can reach these first target levels. We wait. Well, we move on to Tuesday, April 26th. There we have the powerful movement. If we see this on a smaller chart, 15-minute chart, I want to show you a bit what happened here. What happened is an accumulation process you see here. The process starts with false breakouts, false breakouts, accumulations, false breakouts, accumulations, false breakouts, accumulations, false breakouts, accumulations. We also see how they accumulated above to keep pushing the price down. They accumulated to keep pushing the price down, and in the end, what they've done is a failure at 161.8. Therefore, the process has been perfect. We have complete manipulation with a failure at 161.8, which is where we started working. Therefore, the process has been very nice, very nice. If the price now made some kind of interesting retracement, we would add more positions. With the buys protected, we already look on the general map at those first target levels. We wait. Here we have the retracement. So far, nothing unexpected. I'll show you what's happening on the five-minute chart. Notice what happened there. We are going to make a very, very, very specific operation, very, very intraday. We will wait for the price to retest those levels of 4,295. We will enter a short position with a very specific exit also at levels of 4,261. Let's wait for the price to reach that level and we'll enter a position with a very short exit. We wait and execute that position. About to enter those sales, what I'm going to do is take out one of these positions we had higher up. We will take it here. We will gain around 78 points. If we see it on a five-minute chart, it looks like this. There we will be trying to enter the short. We adjust that first exit to those levels. We wait for the price around this little zone. We wait. Perfect. We release the long position, take profit, attack the short position. We go for the target. In this case, we get about 30 points, okay? We wait to see what happens. It could make a new high and then drop. That wouldn't surprise me, but it shouldn't hit my stop. Come on, we wait. Well, about to take profits. Let's see if it reaches those levels. Notice how the general map looks a bit. There you have it. Always, always, always a mindset of dual direction. As you see here on the general map, long swing movement, short intraday movement. Therefore, they are entirely compatible, the mindset of dual direction. Nothing else. The price is behaving well. Entertaining session yesterday and today. And we take a bit of profit. Nothing more, guys. Greetings.",

      "translation": "Good morning, good afternoon. Hello, I am Joaquín Vega, Tuesday, July 20th. Based on the previous video, we continue working on the SP500, 30-minute chart. After having worked on this decline, yesterday we tried to make the new turn around these levels, we failed, we did it again in a subsequent area, lower. There we took three positions again and we continue with the map. We said that in this area it was very likely for the price to return to historical highs and that at these levels of 4,330 points we could again have a downward movement. This is exactly what we are going to want to capture. For now, we will take one of these three positions and make a rise as a partial around 87 points, with two of the three positions we carry upwards. Let's not forget that we also still have a hedge in a sell mode. Therefore, we will attempt to complete that hedge of the sale with a purchase. We will take those two partials and start some short position here. In that little area we will try to sell with a position to capture a drop of this kind. A drop of around 65 points, alright? Therefore, we will wait for the price to enter that little area, there, and we will start some short position after taking those profits. Alright, we wait. Well, guys, we take about 170 points and we are now left with a clean hedge. Short position, long position. You ask me a lot about these hedges. Look, what I intend with the hedges, analysts, you know, always try to deduce or see a bit which are the trends, the most probable movement, the most probable direction. Look, I do not function like that, I do not follow trends, the only thing I follow is fractality. When I try to see or try to locate through our maps areas of possible turn, which is the only thing I'm constantly searching for, I try to capture the start of the fractality and try to capture the end of the fractality. As you see, and since yesterday, here we put in three positions, we have taken out two, here we have put in three more, we have taken out two, therefore, from both the selling movement and the buying movement we have already taken some movement out, therefore I do not care which way the market goes, what I want is to always go with it. In fact, right now we have the price enclosed in this distance, therefore, whether it goes up or down, everything I do inside will first come out for free and if the price breaks above I will go with the purchase, if the price breaks below I will go with the sale. Logically, if the price comes here and reaches the selling positions, I will take out half of the long position and continue with the ongoing position. If the price goes the opposite way, down, I will take out half of the sale and continue with the lower price. As you see, I always have a double direction mindset, therefore, I do not care where the price goes, I want to always go with it, with more or less contract volume, but always want to go with it. This way, I take away the worry of knowing trends and constantly thinking about where the price will go, I only have to search on maps areas of possible turn and try to constantly capture what will never change on a chart, which is the fractality. We reach an area of possible sales, here we will try to place some short position since we could have some downward movement. Nothing more, regards.",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Imagine that you have pattern X, whatever it may be, and you are measuring a pattern and working in the zone of deception. Perfect. That pattern gives you an entry. One of the typical questions you ask me is, 'What happens if when I enter the market with any pattern, whatever it may be, it doesn't matter which one? What happens when that operation requires a stop here below, very small, because when we have stops of 5 or 6 pips, I have to tell you that if you are working with a pattern with those types of stops, you are working on very small charts. So, be careful with that first reflection. Second, the problem with working with 6-point or 6-pip stops, which is the huge problem they have in futures, as we have discussed many times, is that when I have to put these 6 pips, automatically, once I enter the market, I have to go with my tracking fibo, what we do by placing 6 pips is that if the price does this, we have to manage. That is, if the price falls 3 or 4 pips, we have to manage those 3 or 4 pips. What's the huge problem? With working futures and consequently working with these tiny stops, we won't have time. In most cases, we won't have time, because the price can move those 3 or 4 pips in a blink. What does that mean? On one hand, we won't have time to manage in protection. Most times. But also, besides having too small a stop that probably won't allow us to manage well in protection if the trade goes wrong, the added problem is that if we enter with leverage according to those 6 pips, there is a high probability that that trade will fail and, moreover, we are over-leveraged because we only put 6 pips and if we entered according to the 6 pips, we are over-leveraged. Why do I tell you that you should always have minimum and maximum stops? I always tell you, in Forex, you cannot work with less than 12 pips of stop. Why? Because even if I have an entry, like the one we had here that requires 6 pips, I will never put 6 pips. If I work on very small charts and see a trade that, by pattern, requires 6 pips, I will put 12. Why do I put 12? First rule. Because I never enter the Forex market with leverage with stops below 12 pips. That means my lower leverage is always justified with 12 pips. I never calculate entries below 12 pips. It is the minimum leverage with which I always enter. Not only that, but also, whatever the pattern, I know that pattern I am entering and whose correct stop would be here, I am clear, I will make another type of pattern, a deep entry. For example, we are waiting for a calm. And we are waiting for the price to come here. And I know that when the price comes here, right after entering, it requires 6 pips. I will always put 12. Rule number 1. I never enter with leverage that is not in accordance with at least 12 pips. I will not apply more entry due to having less stop. No. 12 pips is my minimum leverage. On one hand, I already enter with leverage, I am making a very short-term trade where I know, in both cases, that if the price comes here, the pattern for which I entered breaks. And if the price comes here, the pattern for which I entered breaks. In both cases, if the price does this or the price does this, the reason for the entries is worthless. What do I do when this happens? Automatically, as I go with a minimum lot management based on 12 pips, I risk less money than someone entering with 6 pips, because the one going with 6 pips usually enters more leveraged. There is a very bad belief, very bad, very bad, very bad. And that is we are going to try to work with the smallest possible stops to enter with the maximum possible leverage. That is horrible. That is the worst. That belief of since I want to earn a lot, I want to leverage a lot. And since I want to leverage a lot, I enter with short stops. That is the worst. The belief of wanting to earn quickly, that's why I enter with a lot. The worst. In other words, the operator who entered with 6 pips enters more leveraged than I do. It's very likely that there won't be time to manage when losing the 61 of the fibo from that movement. Very likely. Therefore, it is highly probable that if the price finally fails the trade, that operator gets taken out quickly without an option to manage and with leverage of 6 pips. Higher than mine. Exactly the same here. When entering, you have to manage half of it there. When you're talking about 2-3 pips for it to do this, there's not enough time to do proper management. Therefore, it will take you out as well. That 6-pip operator will get taken out. With excessive leverage for the risk management he is doing. However, when I see this, the price has entered there, we are both inside, but I go with 12 pips. I am very clear also that if the price comes back to that minimum or comes back to this minimum, the reason for the entry is broken. Therefore, when I go with these types of stops, I say, if the price comes here or the price comes here, I exit with everything. That trade is not valid. I leave with everything. I have enough time to manage. What is the huge difference between the 6-pip operator failing and me failing? Well, that operator who entered with higher leverage than me, we are failing the same trade but he loses more money than I do. He loses more money than I because I lose those 4-5 pips but with leverage of 12. That other person loses the 6 pips with leverage of 6. Therefore, in this type of very short-term trades, where it's very difficult to manage well in protection, that person will always lose more than I do. That's why I always keep the rule that you must have minimum stops. You can't work without them. And be careful, I insist again on comparing with futures. In futures, they are compelled to do this. They are compelled to work with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pips. Because of high costs. They are compelled. They can't do it otherwise. Except, I always tell you that to work with futures you must have an account of at least 50,000. Because working with less is exactly what will happen to you. As you have little capital, you can't afford to put 12 pips. So you have to work to the millimeter. And working to the millimeter you're telling the price I don't let you even breathe. I can't do proper management in protection. That is the huge problem with futures. And since this is not futures, we can afford much greater management solvency. Among other things, instead of putting those 6, 5, 4 pips, I put 12. Because I am financially covered. Because I can reduce the lot size as much as I want. So be very careful. Firstly, we are already working on very short time frames. Because working with 6 pips of stop. Very short time frames. Very dangerous. We're going to fail many trades. Many trades. And if we are going to fail many trades and I can't manage protection well, the final result won't be good. You have to have minimum stops for each of your assets. In Forex, you can have minimum stops for any currency pair. But if you work gold, minimum stops in gold. I always tell you mine. Three-point minimum stop in gold. SP500. Three-point minimum stop in SP500. DAX. Ten-point minimum stop. Those are my minimums. Because they are the minimums that allow me to manage. No matter how short-term I work. Reasonable. And always knowing that by working with stops. The minimum stops in those assets. I am working in short time frames. I will fail many trades. Therefore, protection management there must be perfect. If working in medium and long-term, protection management must be perfect. Not to say when we work in such short time frames. In such precise movements. The management in protection and risk management must be perfect. Because we are going to fail many trades. So be careful with these types of things.",

      "translation": "What is a fractal? A thrust with a twist and a retracement. Okay. What we are looking for is for that twist to break the thrust that brought it, so that it ceases to be a retracement and becomes a new thrust. Yes. This price is going up. For it to turn, something has to happen. What has to happen? I think your mind thinks of Matrix, buddy. Wow, Matrix, okay. What you see is one thing and what it is, is another. Imbalance between supply and demand. That's it, damn. In short, let's write it down. You told me flag pattern. When? People are... Think about Matrix. Think about Matrix. People are going crazy, crazy, crazy buying because it is having a magnificent rally and they are buying, buying, buying. The big players are taking advantage of this to distribute, to sell, sell, sell, sell. Let's see. If this price is going to fall, the first thing that has to happen, what is it? Stop. Stop. It's that simple. Yes. If you are driving and want to make a U-turn, the first thing you need to do, what is it? Brake. Stop. Step number one. Brake. For something to stop rising, there has to be something to stop it, right? Yes. What is it? The only way to stop something that is rising and something that is falling is to have something going against it. What we are saying, then, is that there must be something going down and something going up here. Notice that I'm telling you something. It doesn't matter what it is, yes. I don't care what it is. It's obvious they are contrary positions. Once it stops, what is step number two? Start turning. Okay. Damn. Okay. Why does it turn? It not only stops, but it turns. It starts to turn around, of course. Okay. Therefore, when there is a turn, there is a triggering of stops of contrary movements plus selling. Conversely, the counterpart of buying is given by the stops of those selling plus the buying. Then the turn will be larger or smaller. But if there is a turn, it's because there has been that. Always counterpart. And always triggering stops. Where can I find this and where can I find this? Where? In my working zones. At what moment can I sense that there may be that which I am looking for, which is stop, buy and stops? Because without that, there is no turn. Place this figure in your brain. But if I were you, María, get a tattoo. Why am I telling you this? Why do I say that this is a tremendous figure? What is happening in that figure? Because many things are happening. This comes from above, from wherever it comes. This comes from below, from wherever it comes. How many things are happening there? Look, notice. For you to understand the figure, let's go step by step. Let's go with this. This is the figure. But for that figure to form, things happen first. The price was falling, it stopped, turned, and began to reverse the movement. There were people falling, and from there, the movement starts to turn around on them. They have stops somewhere, but depending on where they come from, they will have them closer or farther away. And right now, also, as the turn begins to occur, there will be people deciding to enter the buy and placing the stop-loss right below that peak. More precisely or less precisely. Perfect. Good. Will it rise where it has to rise? Yes. What happens when this happens? All who had been encouraged to get into the bullish movement are now out. They have been stopped out. What is commanding here, selling or buying? Selling. Right. Why is there more selling here? All those orders. Those who have bought here? Yes. Now... stops are sales. They are sales, yes. Right. Therefore, even through the stops, there are already sales entering? Yes. Right. What else is happening here? There are more people. Apart from the stops being activated to increase sales, because there are also people who are encouraged to see this movement, they are entering too. Right. Therefore, not only are there sales due to stops, but there are also sales from new operations. Yes. In other words, what is happening at this moment? There is a lot of counterpart for you to buy. Yes. Good. The stop-loss zone of buyers who did this or who have joined here is a small zone...not an exact point, but a small zone. People adjust the stops very closely. Right. But, what happens? New sellers are joining, and these sellers do not join just any way. They do not all join in the same spot because sellers, some see that it is breaking this low and just when the low breaks, they join, because they already consider it a level break. Yes. But others will wait for the price to drop a little more and others a little more. Here it depends a bit on each one's rule as to what constitutes a break. Yes, even if it’s the pullback or whatever. That is why our counterparty zone not only includes the stop level, the small zone of stops but also gives a margin for the later sellers to join, up to the one who joins here. That is why I give a margin to 161.8. I allow them to join in the break even up to 161.8. Then, I conclude, that is why this is our deception pattern; I conclude that all those who have not already joined in selling, at the break, above 161.8 will not join. If they haven't joined yet, they won't join. So, I need if indeed someone, anyone, is taking advantage of the counterpart of the stops of the last buyers and is taking advantage of those entering the sale, if someone is trying to take advantage, from here it has to rise. Of course. Because if it doesn’t rise, I assume they don’t intend to take advantage of that counterpart. And that those who sold will continue to ride. And those who have sold keep gaining, but I'm not looking to join the movement's direction. I want them to take the counterpart because that's exactly where I want to enter. Therefore, if I see that it indeed respects that 161 and starts to rise, I already have all the ingredients to be able to think that I have stops, buy, and stop. From that moment on, I sense that there is an option they are using the counterpart we have described. Yes. Then I don't know if they will do it or not, but I have the conditions. Yes. Do you understand what the first deception pattern is? Yes. As you well know, there is a second and third deception pattern. It is when they are linking. What I realized is that if I have 100 contracts to enter, here I only have 50. I will absorb them, yes, but I need to generate 50 more. I make a new figure, and poof. Of course. That's why there is a second deception pattern. Hey, no. I had 150. Here I have 50 in the second. I have 50, but I'm missing 50 more. Another same figure. Because, in the end, it's the same. Yes. Sure. That's how it is, you know? Uh-huh.",

      "translation": "Only a third group is missing because he opens the restaurant to make money. My question is, with the numbers he has here, does he know how much each winning trade should make? Does he know how much he has to charge for each table served? He doesn't know the minimum success rate. He doesn't know how many people will come in, but he needs to make sure that each time someone sits at a table, it compensates him. The question is, how much should he charge per table? What type of profits should he use? He knows the risk per table, in goods, is 5 euros. But now, how much should he charge? We have to have an idea or should he set the price arbitrarily? It's clear he should earn more than 5, right? But how much more? Let's see, look at what I have here. Remember he's going to make 4 trades a day. If he's going to make 4 trades a day, the only sequences that can occur are these. He makes the first one, it fails. Makes the second, it fails. Makes the third, it fails. And makes the fourth, it fails. He fails everything. Fails 3, succeeds 1. I don't care about the order. I don't care about the order. When there are winners and losers, I don't care about the order. He's going to make 4. Wins 2, succeeds 2. Sorry, wins 2, fails 2. Fails 1, succeeds 3. Sorry, or succeeds in all. There's no other sequence, or yes, there is another sequence that can occur each day. Each day he can face this, per day, because he has committed to making 4 a day. My question is, can any other sequence occur in his operations? Do you see any other possibility? Fails everything, succeeds 1, succeeds 2, succeeds 3, or succeeds 4. Okay, let's do the math. The risk he will assume per trade is 5 euros. That's what we have established in the plan. Okay, what would happen the first day he makes this sequence if we were at a 1 to 1 ratio? 5, 10, 15, 20. No doubt. Here he loses minus 20 euros. Everything failed. At 5 euros per 4, minus 20. Next sequence, at 1 to 1, how much would he fail or what would be the final result? Failing 3 and succeeding 1, minus 10. Third sequence, fails 2, succeeds 2, final result, 0. Good. Fourth sequence, succeeds 3, fails 1, final result, plus 10. Succeeds everything. 5 by 4, 20. Plus 20. Perfect. But let's see with 1 to 3. I fail everything. I still lose the same. Minus 20. Second sequence, fail 3, succeed 1. Here I win based on plus 10. Here I win based on plus 15. Okay, final result, 0. Perfect. Third sequence, win 2, fail 2. Plus 20. Fourth sequence, succeed 3, fail 1. 40. Last sequence, win everything. Plus 60. Let's go with a new sequence. Let's put an example at 1, 4. Now you win based on 4, win based on plus 20. 5 by 4, 20, because the risk remains the same. Come on, first sequence, I always lose the same. Second sequence, plus 5. Good. Third sequence, 2 and 2. Plus 30. Fourth sequence, win 3, fail 1. 55. Last sequence, I win everything. Plus 80. And let's do the last example with 1 to 5. Each time I win, I win based on 25. Risk remains the same. First sequence, I fail everything, minus 20. Second sequence, fail 3, win 1. Plus 10. Third sequence, 2 and 2. Plus 40. Fourth sequence, win 3, fail 1. Plus 70. Good. Last sequence, succeed everything. Plus 100. Basically, what Pepe is deciding here is how much he wants to charge for each table. The goods for each of his tables cost him 5 euros. That is, what is served at each table will cost him 5 euros. He has the option of charging the same as he risks, what he pays. He has the option of charging double. He has the option of charging triple. 4 times more, 5 times more, 6 times more, 7 times more, 8 times more, whatever he wants. What is the difference or what is the problem or virtue of charging more or less? Of going for a higher or lower ratio? What are the advantages and disadvantages? You have them in these numbers and sequences. What do you think? Which should he choose and why? Advantages and disadvantages. Let's not think about charts, let's not think about trading, think about the restaurant. The cheaper he charges, the more people he has. The more expensive he charges, the fewer people can afford it. If he charges 1 to 1, if he charges the same as he risks, he will surely have a lot of people every day. Surely. But if he charges 5 times more, not everyone will be able to afford it, it will be a somewhat expensive restaurant. It is true that those who come will leave him more money per table, but it will not be full surely. So here Pepe has to decide, what do I want? Do I prefer to always have the restaurant full even if I only earn very little or nothing despite having the restaurant full? That helps me mentally to think that my business works. But be careful because when you do the math, Pepe, mentally you say, my business is doing great. But when you do the billing at the end of the month and deduct what you've been charged for goods, be careful with the surprise you may get. You have mentally kept the restaurant full, and you say, darn, I'm doing well. But be careful when you do the billing at the end of the month. Be careful, eh. Everything can come crashing down. On the contrary, if you charge 5 times more than what it costs you, the restaurant will daily have very few people. But it's possible that when you do the billing, you will have earned more than having it full. Therefore, Pepe, you are the one who will be in the restaurant every day. Keep in mind that you are there to make money. But remember, you are the one who will have to live with whether your restaurant has people or not. That will mentally disappoint you. Because what matters to you is the billing. But, as you can see, billing can be done in many different ways. How much do you want to charge per table? There will be business owners who want to have lots of people despite earning very little. And there will be other business owners who set their gourmet restaurant, and who only want customers to leave 5 times more each time they enter. Which one does it better? In trading, it's the same. Because it is no different from any other darn business. The question is, how do you want to charge the table? With the pros and cons it has. All can be good, but if you make a mistake, if you say, no, no, no, I want my restaurant each time people come 5 times more. But when you see only 2 come in a day, don’t get agitated. Don’t get agitated because then you’re making a mistake. Or if you take short billing, I will charge almost the same. When you do the billing, don’t get let down. Here you can’t go wrong, because you will despair if you make a mistake. And as you see, we can have many ways to do it. Which is the right one? You have to handle it. Weigh the pros and cons and how you charge. Evaluate it before starting. Don’t stress out in the middle of the month. Either because you have a lot of people and then earn little, or because you have very few people and want to earn more. Be careful how you do it because this mistake can cause your work to break down. When we translate this to trading, where we know we are going to make four trades a day and there are only five sequences that can happen daily. Either I fail all, succeed one, succeed two, succeed three, or succeed all four. Don’t twist it more, there are no other options. Therefore, each day you face a chart, you already know that these exist. What happens? I always tell you, let’s try to have a daily positive numerical hope towards us. And I want you to understand what it means for me, I repeat, for me, to have positive numerical hope for you daily. If I have five possible sequences, what do you want? The largest amount of sequences to your favor. Surely, that any of these sequences, most cause me money, generate money for me. Be it more or less, but that it doesn’t generate loss. Let's go with case number one. At one-to-one, five possible sequences. I only win with two of them. Negative numerical sequence. I lose everything, I lose. If I succeed one, I lose. And if I succeed two, I stay the same. I’m not interested. Simple. Out of five, only two interest me, it’s going to be a no. One-to-one, no. Let's go to the next one. In this case, I win in one, I win in two, and I win in three. In this case, with one-to-two, positive. Let's go to the third. How many do I win? I win in one, I win in two, I win in three. Positive. The fourth. I win in one, I win in two, I win in three. I have plus three here, plus three here, plus four here and plus four here. And I have plus two here. Okay. Can you draw the conclusion? If I have five sequences every day, I want the most possible on my side. In other words, four trades a day and five possible sequences, I want four on my side. Meaning that only in one of the sequences, it causes me a loss, which is failing everything. In the rest of the options, I sum. I don’t know about you, but I do. Do you understand the importance of numbers? We are not inventing anything. I do not want to work at one-to-two. I do not want to work at one-to-three. Can it be done? Yes. But I am clear that I face each day with four sequences in my favor and one against. And that gives me peace. Not only are we saying that with one-to-four, I have four of the sequences in my favor. From one-to-four forward, I have the four sequences out of five in my favor. But as you see, from plus four onward, all are in my favor for four of the sequences. But that person, Pepe, the minimum they should charge is one-to-four, at 20. Therefore, if we have determined the most important thing, which is the minimum, now Pepe must decide if he stops there, ensuring that the minimum he earns in the worst sequence is 5, 30, 55, 80, or he gives it one more point and says, no, 10, 40, 70, 100. We already know that the four sequences are in our favor. But now see the amount. Which do you want? You know the minimum. But the numerical amount of each sequence, which do you want? Because I can go one-to-six, one-to-seven, one-to-eight, and the numerical amounts of each sequence will keep growing. How do you charge the dishes? What do you want it to be? A little gourmet or very gourmet? Or do you want it to be a Michelin star? How do you want it? If it’s a Michelin star, the more Michelin it is, the more expensive. And fewer people will enter. Be careful. It will take you longer to enter people with much less frequency. You will win trades with much less frequency. Where do you set your limit? How do you feel better? Remember you are in the restaurant every day. If today nobody enters because you’ve charged it, at one-to-eight, eight times more than what it costs you, don’t complain. Don’t have set it so high. Here is where the individually determining part lies. Don’t forget that it's paid for by those who come in. The more expensive, the fewer come in. The cheaper, the more frequently they come in. Now you decide. Because all can be good, and all can be terrible if you make a mistake. Don’t complain if only four people come in all month. Don’t complain if you succeed in four trades in a month. That you have set the dish and the price. Don’t come saying later that my business is not going. No, it doesn’t work because you have set it too high. And you want people to come every day on top of it. That can’t be. One or the other. You can’t have it both ways. What you can’t have is to have it at 120 and have the restaurant full every day the first year you open it. Forget it. We’ll see later. But now no. Nobody knows you, you’re new. Look at how you charge the dish. Because every day you will have to fulfill it. What you can’t do is charge 120 today, 60 tomorrow, 40 the next day, because they will think you are ridiculous. And in the end nobody will come in. What a lousy restaurant. We don't know how much they are going to charge for the food today. This is what happens to you. You stand in front of the graph and don’t know how much you are going to charge for the dish. Depending on how the day looks. That’s what cannot be. What do you think of this? The food can be wonderful. The restaurant can be beautiful. But there is a person who manages it. And if the person who manages it is not good, no nice restaurant, nice food, or anything else will matter. Because this is what happens to you. The operation can be wonderful. But if the person who manages the operation doesn’t know how to run the restaurant, no matter what you do. It’s the same. Why would we act differently in trading than in a restaurant? Would you do that? Would you change prices every day in a restaurant if you opened one? Would you do that? Then why here yes? Here you allow everything. Do you know why you allow everything here? Because the main difference between the restaurant and trading is that when the restaurant messes up, people see it. And it would make your business fail. But when you are trading, you are alone. There are no people entering your establishment. You are alone. So you deceive yourself. I change the menu every day because as nobody sees me, who cares. And if it goes wrong and I lose money, nobody sees me. I deceive myself. But when you are in the restaurant in front of the public or when you are managing someone else's money account, there you have it tough. I just want you to think, if I gave each of you 100,000 euros to invest for me, I would be watching that menu. If one day you want to work with someone else's money, you will have to respect the menu. But if you are deceiving yourself alone every day because nobody sees you, the day you want to do that, how will you do it? If you have learned to deceive yourself. You will never do it, you won’t be able to, you won’t know how. That’s why it makes me laugh a lot when people go looking for funded accounts and when they go to seek other people’s money. And most of you are not even capable of controlling yourselves. How do you want to control someone else’s money that they will be watching you? They will take the money away from you immediately when they see you are changing the menu. It’s continual self-deception. I change prices when I want. I change dishes when I want. I change risks when I want. The business numerically does not work, impossible. And then we blame, no, it was the product. It's just that they sold me fish that wasn’t good. No, bastard, no. It's not that it was the price, that it didn’t follow me. No, bastard, no, no. Don’t deceive yourself, stop deceiving yourself already once and for all. The numbers are simple, they are what they are. And the ways to do it are what they are. Commit to one and stick to it. Therefore, what we are establishing, and in this case what we are going to do, is establish that Pepe’s minimum gain is 1 to 4. In other words, each time he wins, it will be 20 euros in profits. We could set 1 to 4, 1 to 5, 1 to 6, 1 to 7, 1 to 8, 1 to 9, 1 to 10, 1 to 50,000. In this case, Pepe is satisfied with that 1 to 4 for having 4 consequences in his favor.",

      "translation": "You know that I'm all about numbers and to me numbers are everything, but of course, it's not enough, it's not enough, it's not enough. We have to be more intelligent for certain things. Look, there's something called context. There's something that's vital that you understand, apply, assimilate, and engrave in yourself. Let's see. It's the before and after when you're working. What is the before and after? Notice I put context up there. Look, I'll give you an example. Today I made three attempts on gold, the first two failed, and now I'm on a third attempt. If we get stuck in the mindset of I must always do it the same way, if we get stuck there, and it's true, you have to always do it the same way, but if we stay there without understanding what context means, we're missing something. Should I always do the same thing? Yes, but I must always do the same thing in a generic way, okay? But this generic form can be altered by the context of the situation we have. When I talk about context, I'm not just talking about the context that happens in a chart, but the context of the day I'm having or even the week I'm having. That generic concept, depending on the context we are living in or immersed in, should be made a base mother generic concept if we must have a certain flexibility. It's like, for example, the case with gold today, in my case. Look, if we stick to the generic context, that is, the generic part, purely generic, you usually have a way of analyzing, in that analysis, some work zones appear, you're clear in those zones if you've decided some execution forms. We have all this clear, and we decide all this beforehand. Before facing any chart, I have all these concepts parametrized. I have numbers, of course, that execution is based on numbers. It is essential to have this generic part, no doubt, we all must have it and also balanced. Both the analysis, the zones, the execution, and the numbers must be balanced. That is something that is the foundation of everything, yes, without a doubt. But of course, there are two different contexts. The moment we click and we're already in the market, many things come into play. I need you to understand that here, the generic part is no longer valid, once you're with the order in the market. There's nothing you can do to make that price do what you want or not. That damn price will do whatever it wants. If that price does what it wants, you have to act with it. You can't stay stuck in the damn generic part. Guys, you need to understand that now the price is what conditions everything. To make you understand, look, every time I make a trade, I'm thinking about my results curve. I can perfectly apply the analysis, the zone, the execution, the numbers, everything, but when I make the click here, the results curve. This is what comes to my mind. What do I mean by this? I might get the trade right or not, it no longer depends on me, but in my damn head, I have that this curve doesn't fall. If I said I entered here and I put my stops here, I've executed different... you know I enter fractionally, for example, it's decided beforehand. I apply what I said before. So I will apply what I said before, but notice, here a thousand things already come into play. Hey, how's my day going? Is it going well? Is it going poorly? Is it going average? Because look, imagine I have my first partials here, according to the before. Also imagine that I have my finals here, but now there are different contexts playing, which is how my damn day is going. How's my week going? I won't go further. Every time I open a position, I'm very clear in my head what the context of the day and the week is, without a doubt. Then, first context, context 1, my results curve situation. Because I assure you one thing, I don't care about winning the trade or not winning it, but I don't want to fall. So, what happens? What happens if I've already taken positions in my favor? What happens if that day I'm in profit? For example, the context is different. Why? Because I know my results curve is in favor. So, my way of acting is not the same as if it's against, damn it. It’s not the same for me to have a good day as to have a bad day. I'll give you the gold example. Three attempts today, the first two fail. When I say they fail, I mean they don't give me partials. It doesn’t mean they've caused me much of a loss. If I know today that gold has thrown me off twice, for as little loss as it may have generated, it's a loss. And my obsession is the damn results curve. It's one of the factors that burst in my head. So, I set up mechanisms. The results curve will do what I say, it will fall if I want it to fall. It's that simple, guys. That curve falls as much as I let it fall, not what the market wants. And I need you to understand this. The curve falls as I want it to fall, no matter how much I fail. Let's see, let's go to the specific trade. The price starts to move. Context. Two failed trades. I make the third attempt. Do you think I’m going to act on the third attempt as in the previous two? No. No, because the context is what it is, damn it. If my priority is the results curve, I'm right now with a small loss. Let's suppose I'm with a small loss. X, small, small. When I open this third position, the first thing my head thinks is, ok, how much did I lose in the previous two? Because, you know something? I know perfectly well how my day is going. I know perfectly well how much I'm losing now or how much I'm gaining now. It's my damn job. Knowing what's happening with my trading today and yesterday and the day before yesterday. So, I know perfectly well how I’m doing. Let's imagine that in the two previous losses they caused me a loss of 100 euros. I’m going with minus 100. X percentage with respect to my account. I'm inventing everything. When I’m making this third one, my top priority, one, is not to win the damn trade. It’s not for the price to come to my partial here, which is what the generic side says, and for my final to come here. No, sir. The first thing I’m going to do is, at what point in this movement if it falls in my favor? I recover 100, at least if I've put in three positions here, as if I have to take out two that add up to 100. If the generic partial is here, imagine I've put in three and here the sum of two of them gives me plus 100, to hell with the generic partial. My curve doesn't fall. Therefore, when the price comes here, if it does, two go out. Damn, Joaquín, then you’re changing the methodology. Dude, I'm changing the methodology due to the context I have and I won't even tell you if I have two bad days. I started the week, Monday and Tuesday, minus 200. When Wednesday starts, my damn obsession is to recover those 200. I'm not thinking about more as priority one. My account falls what I say it falls, I've said.",

      "translation": "Well, let's see. The other day I met a person, not a student, a businessman, and I explained to him how he should approach, in which phases I would tell him he should pass to be able to do this trading thing. We went to a talk, I was introduced to him, and such, and I spent some time, and I’m going to tell you a bit about what I told him because you know I am very, for some things, when I do group sessions there are certain topics that I always touch on, always, no matter what the sessions are about, there are certain topics that I always touch on because, through repetition, it's the only way I can drill them down, through repetition and repeat, always trying to do it in different ways, or at least explain it in different ways. Today is going to be one of those sessions. Look, I’m going to tell you what I told this man. I explained to him that in this there are five phases. I'm going to tell you exactly how I explained it to him, not only did I write it on a piece of paper and everything. He asked me to write it down on a piece of paper. The first phase you have to train, and now I am studying by themes, subjects, which have nothing to do with each other, theme one, theme two, theme three, and also it's thematic content that is correlated, you should not move on to theme two if you do not know theme one, you shouldn’t go to three if you haven’t understood two, because in the end, it forms a whole and if you miss part of the information, you reach five and you have no clue, you reach theme five and you have no clue because everything is hierarchical, in trading, it’s exactly the same. And if the correct order isn't followed, we're going to have a problem with theme five. If we reach theme five without having studied the previous four properly, then unfortunately, we've wasted our time. Yes, we're on theme five, but it hasn't served any purpose. So let's see if by explaining it as I explained it to this man, I can give you one more point to have a clear idea. It seems that many of you reach theme five, but do not have the previous four right. Therefore, it seems that we are very advanced in five, but no, we are far behind. And this is the problem: the phases we have studied have not been done well. The first phase of any trader should be, let me summarize, working very well with very adequate lot sizes that utilize stop sizes, which means this union of lot sizes and stop sizes, ultimately means risk management, this is what we're talking about, you must have such absolute risk control that is entirely based and controlled against the pain that the sequence of losses will cause you, which yes or yes, you’re going to have. This is theme number one, meaning if I do not have this clear, all I do afterward doesn't matter at all, zero. Learn to walk, ultimately, what risk should I use so that no kind of pain affects me in the sequence of losers. Here, you should spend all the necessary time practicing this, so that when you face any system, this is 100% under control. Notice what I'm telling you, I don't care if you spend a month, two months, three months, six months, or 23 months, you should never move on to lesson number two without this, because if you move on to lesson number two without this, you are wasting your time. The control of risk which is absolutely linked to some lot sizes and stop sizes. It is the cornerstone of everything. The base, one step forward, then the other. I need, when I begin to walk in trading, to be sure I never fall. This is the cornerstone, this is the key piece. To practice this, I do not need any system. I've told you a thousand times how to practice this. You should do hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tests. Logically, this is entirely linked to a business plan. Obviously, you should change and test enough business plans with chart tests, with random entries enough to be completely sure that there’s nothing in a chart that could affect me. What's the worst? We always say it, the sequence of losing trades. You must know what sequence of losing trades you tolerate without any problem, and for that, this sequence of losing trades will logically be related to some stop sizes and some lot sizes. I don't care the reason for the entry. If I do not have this, you will not be successful in trading in your life. Never. Ever. Impossible. It cannot be done. It is not possible. Essential condition. I don’t know how to say it. Without this, you do not win. You play, but you don't win. You can think you are trading, but you don't win. Once you have this, however long it takes to know this, lesson number two would be the other piece missing to the operation, which is to know absolutely the exit, the profit, that meets exactly the same requirement. What size of exit profit is completely balanced to my pain? What exit do I support? How am I going to know the essential complement of risk? If I already know the risk, now I need to do tests again to know not the exit I want, but the exit I endure. In the end, we are talking about pains, as always, once more. Risk pain, exit pain. Forget what you want. I have always told you. It is not valid. The way to win is two, lesson number two. In order for me to move on to lesson two, I must know 100% exactly how I manage risk. If I do not know how I manage loss, how am I going to know how I manage exit? And here again, hundreds and hundreds of trades. And I test with 1-1, and I test with 1-2, and I test with 1-3, and I test with 1-4, with the risk I have already learned from lesson number one, with the lot sizes I have learned from lesson number one, with the stop sizes I have learned from lesson number one. Random entries and a new profit, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds. If I have the two lessons done right, if I already know how to lose comfortably, never going beyond my pain, if I already know how to win comfortably, accepting what I bear, I am able to use a method, whatever it is. But I can't look for a method if I don’t have lesson one and lesson two, which we think is a method. How do you establish the basis so that nothing on a chart affects you? How do you establish the bases for an operation to be indifferent about losing or winning it? How is this established? Only in this way. Nothing can alter me in front of a chart. Test, error, test, error, test, error, test, error, hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds. But when I go live, I have to be 100% certain. Once I have lesson number one and lesson number two, which have already made me a rock, where there can be a psychological aspect that affects me? There isn't. There isn't. The third step, lesson number three, would be what are my actions post-entry? When I enter the market, however it might be, with whatever method it might be, with however analysis it might be, once I enter, where I have absolutely controlled stops, therefore even if the stop hits, it won't affect me, and where I have absolutely controlled profit sizes that won't affect me, what conditions of action am I going to put on a post-entry after entering? I put them. Should we put them? It is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended. For me, it is vital. Not only does it not condition me to loss, not only does it not condition me to exit, because I know I handle it well, but I will not even let the price command me, I command it. Meaning, I command the price, not in what it will do, but in my response to what it does. I command my risk pain, I command my loss pain, I command my profit pain. I am the boss of the chart. The boss. Now yes, rules have to be set. Strict ones. Test, error, test, error, test, error. Once again. Test, error, test, error. I put this, I am comfortable, I put this, I am comfortable, I put this, I am comfortable, I put this, I am comfortable. Again. Test, error, test, error, test, error. Time, time, time, time. The fourth is a consequence of the three previous lessons. All the practice you have done, all that work you have done, for each of those lessons, without wanting to, if you have done that work properly, without wanting to, you have been training a fundamental piece, which is the discipline of execution, without wanting to. You have done it so many times that you have generated, you have cultivated the discipline, guys, without intention. Because to know the risks, you have had to execute that repetition with discipline. And another one, and another one, and another one. Unknown sequences. I test with this, and now I test with the other. It is supposed that you are repeating, repeating, repeating. For the profit, the same. You are generating discipline. When making these strict rules, having tested them so many times, you have generated discipline again. You have discipline in the three areas. Without intending to. To who. Time, time, time. Test, error, test, error, test, error. And finally, the last phase. I am going to look for an analysis method. Plus entry. The last thing. Repeat, the last. Do you all remember when I always tell you, give me the method you want, and give me the entry you want? I set the rest. And I make it win. Why do I tell you that? Because of the four previous phases. I have them so entrenched, that with little adjustments to the four preceding phases, with a small adjustment of the risk, with a small adjustment of the profit, with small adjustments of the post-entry rules, I make it win with the analysis method you give me. Any you want. Let me perform enough trades and I make it win. But it is based on the four previous phases, because they are the essence. And now, of course, the usual. Where do you spend 95% of the time? In phase 5. What’s the problem? That four previous ones are lacking, dude. You’re screwed. The typical ones and those so many, many, many, many hours of that entry and analysis method, you should have dedicated to the previous four. When you reach 5 without the previous four solid, well what happens is that you are in theme 5, you have wasted your time. You are wasting your time. You’ll have to go back to phase 1 at some point, if you want to win. Because to solve the problem of 5, you have to have reviewed the previous four. So, the worst that can happen to you is to be in 5 not knowing the previous four. Because the only solution there is not to keep wasting time is, at some given moment, stop and go back to 1. Let’s say that when you are new, when you start, phase 1 takes a long time by itself. Phase 2 takes a long time by itself. Phase 3, a long time. That is to say, when you start, each of them takes a very long time. Now, once you have gone through all that learning, you already know where you are failing. You know if the profit is failing you. You know if a little bit of risk is failing you. You know if that adjustment you made to post-entry rules is too strict. I mean, you notice right away once you have experience. But once you have gone through all that path, it is tiny, it is like if you give me now an analysis method. I can start from lot sizes, stops, a risk. I mean, I would start from these four previous factors to test that analysis method and that entry you are offering me, that I have not even tested. When I try 100 trades or 50 trades, I already know what adjustments I have to make to it. Here I have to put longer stops and I have to reduce the lot size, or I have to put it a longer or shorter profit, or these entry rules are not valid for this way you are telling me. I mean, it is noted. But it is because of the so much test-error you have done. If you have done it right. If you have done it right. This is the typical sequence where I used to say that each of these things I tested in sequence of 300 trades. 300 trades, 300 trades, 300 trades, 300 trades, 300 trades. Are you aware of the background that gives you? That is why you come now to me with a way to analyze the market. You give me a form of entry and I tell you, okay, let me 500 trades minimum. Let me 500 trades to find the point. Sure I find it. I am not saying that I win a lot or little. I am saying that I make it win in a sufficient number of trades. I make it win. I don't know if a lot or little. It will also depend a lot on the form of entry you are telling me. In the end, I want you to understand something. This combination of four is the method. And let us say that five is the trigger. But the method itself is the first four. You have a wrong thought and it is very common, very common when we talk or think about a trading method, we are constantly thinking about the analysis and entry method. As if that were the base, like that's the power, as if that were the solid part. How solid is your method, right? The analysis method with which you analyze and the one with which you enter, that is the entry point. What I am trying to convey is that this is only the trigger, that this is not the method. That has nothing to do with a method. It may be a method of analysis, okay? But when we talk about a consistent method of doing trading, we are not talking about entry methods. This was the first thing I noticed with this man. That trading method you have, what I saw you with the videos and such, you have a trading method based on cycles and based on entries and deception. My trading method is really solid. The thing is, you have the thought that the trading method is what is seen with the cycles, that this is a trigger, that the real power is not in the cycles, that it is not in any analysis method, that it is not in any entry method, that I need you to understand this. Then, I think it's very good that when you are, when you are a novice you think like that. This man, for example, had never done trading. Well, I can understand that he thinks that way. Especially, every time he looks at something on YouTube, basically it is spoken that way, the analysis method and entry method. No, dude, the power is not there, but neither in my method nor in any. It is a simple trigger, it is a simple shot. The power is in the first four and in the base you have more solid or less solid when applying the first four. Let us say this is like an iceberg. This is the tip that is seen, but the real iceberg is here. This is what is not seen. This is what is not seen. And this is what people do not understand. So many of you continue to think like that. You see the tip, what is seen, but what is behind? What is below the water? That is the true key. Then, if we do not change the way of thinking, we cannot do this. If what we are thinking is that the power of trading is in the analysis and in the entry, we are focusing on the tip of the iceberg. It is a huge mistake. It is already a matter of mentality. For you to see that way, that analysis form, those cycles, those zones, that method you want, to see those moments where you enter and after 500 trades you are in positive or after 1,000 trades you are in positive, there is a huge work underwater, which is the one that makes that damn iceberg firm. So, we cannot focus on what is posted in YouTube entries or that absurd mentality, that novice mentality of thinking that the power is there. They are here in each of these four points. Without this base, that little tip of iceberg you see, yours, submerges into the water, disappears. That is why a consistent trader has a very powerful base. That is why he is consistent. But of course, the work behind is huge. Then, the question you have to ask yourself is, these four phases? How solid am I? Am I sure of the lot sizes I use and the stop sizes or do I use the ones I please? Have I really checked that these are mine? Have I verified that the risks I use withstand any losing sequence? Have I checked it? Answer yourselves. That profit exit, am I using the one I like, the one I desire? That thing of letting run to the opposite zones and what the map says and all the roll, is it really what suits me? Is it what makes me win? Is it what makes me calm? Do I take that exit well without any problem? Have I tested different ones? Have I tested several? Or did I get stuck with this? Or did I test one a little bit and stay with this because it's the one, I don’t know? Have you tested that you hold that exit without pain? Are you sure? The post-entry actions? If I don’t use them, and what happens if I use them? Hey, I'm not used to placing post-entry, post-entry actions. What if I used them? Okay, and if I use them, which ones do I use? Because when I enter the market, what's creating insecurity for me? Hey, and should those rules be to move the stop, to take partial, what the hell should it be? To enter with split-entry? How should it be? Because I assure you that in each of these factors there is a detail that is the one that suits you best, but if you don’t find it, you don’t know it. It's about that. I have tested so many things that I know what works well and what doesn't. That is the key. That is, I don’t use something because I know it doesn't work well for me. When I decide to work with some risks, I decide to work with that risk, with those lot sizes and with those stops because I know they are the correct ones for me. Because I have tested other options and I know that for some reason they do not work for me. Either for a mental issue, either because I am unable to repeat it, or because it bothers me, for whatever reason. But when we talk about lot sizes, there is one that is yours. When we talk about stop sizes, there is one that is yours. When we talk about risks to protect against the sequences, there is a risk that is yours. It combines lot sizes, stops, and pain. Combine everything. You must know what it is because you have it. And it's individual, it's personal, it doesn't work for anyone else, but it works for you. How long to test it? As much as necessary. But you must know it, the profit. I assure you that profit is a very delicate thing, but it is as delicate as risks. Because if I do risks right and I don’t do the exit right, I'm screwed just the same. They cannot be separated. They are part of the same operation, they go together, they are indivisible. It is like hit percentage, fail percentage. It cannot be separated. You cannot do one thing right and the other wrong. Or both right or it goes wrong. Therefore, it is the same work, as much for risk as for profit. And here we are not talking about what you like, I always tell you. There is an ideal profit for each one of you. How is it possible that I don’t know what my ideal profit is? Over and over, over and over, over and over. I cannot feel the slightest pain, neither for the risks, nor for the profits. It cannot be. I do not care if it takes a long time to reach my profit, I bear it. I do not care if risks give me 28 losing trades, I bear it. I am a damn rock. I do not care, however bad the entry is, I bear everything, but everything. However lousy streak I have, because the market does not fit my method, I don’t care, I am a damn rock. And that, many times you say, it’s that, damn, I make these entries, they don’t reach the target and I lose confidence. Damn it. Do this I just told you. You will see how you have confidence. The confidence of saying, I don’t care, I know nothing happens. That is confidence. Not that they don’t reach. But how is it that they don’t reach? Well, let them not reach, they will reach. But I have the confidence that what I am doing is precisely what I should do. Point. Because I have verified it. And of course, you can't have discipline if you don't have confidence. And when I talk about confidence, it's not the confidence that I open this trade, and it's going to hit target. I don't know if it's going to hit target or not. I have the confidence that if I do this with discipline, I make money. And if you want, I put it another way. I have the confidence that if I do this with discipline, if I lose, I lose little. Put it whichever way you want. But you can't have discipline if you don't have confidence. It is impossible. Repetition, another fundamental part, repetition discipline to have repetition of action. A repetition of action doing actions that I know exactly which are mine, that I know exists a exits that are mine and that I know which is the lot sizes I should apply. I have the confidence to repeat that with discipline. This is what takes time. And here is where the juice is. When we are spending all the time on the tip, you are wasting time, folks. And there is nothing that bothers me more than you wasting time. Because this is very easy to understand. And all of you now that I am telling you, explaining this, you all know that it is so. But do you know what the problem is? That one of the things that torments you all the most, in general, is time. Giving time to the boring, because this is all very boring, what is fun is on the chart. That is what is fun in the analysis method, hitting the operation at the entry point. That waste of time, in quotes, that you believe is doing all this, as it is not attractive, as it is not suggestive, as it is not visible, as it is not seen on the chart, boom, I hit the operation, as this is a dirty work, you do not do it. You do not do it. I am fed up with doing the dirty work. But it cannot be done in another way. When I did this, with trading, the 1, the 2, the 3, and the 4, I was fed up with making entries, testing risks, testing profits, testing rules after entering. I was fed up. But for the trader certificate, you either do it or you do the dirty work, or there's no title. You can call yourself a trader, but you’re not a trader. You play trading, but there is no dirty work behind.",

    "title": "Debate entre traders SOBRE EL DRAWDOWN EN TRADING. Joaquín Vega, Pablo Ortiz y Víctor Gómez ( 1/3 ).",
    "analysis": {
      "translation": "Hello guys, today we've gathered here with some colleagues because we wanted to discuss a topic with you once again that we find super interesting. What better than being here with people who are educating others, students, especially on this topic where they surely emphasize a lot, we'd like to talk a bit about this. Trying to give the guys here, Pablo Ortiz, Víctor Gómez, how are you guys? Very good. Very good, Joaquín, very good. Very good, Pablo, how are you? What do you guys think we should talk about? Well, I think we should delve into the drawdown, which brought up a lot of questions. Important topic, right? Yes, yes. How could we approach the topic of drawdown to tackle it intensely, Pablo? Well, I think by perhaps looking at a couple of different aspects, if you want, we can start. Is there a magic number where we should stop? Is there a magic percentage, or does it not matter, or does it depend on the moment? What do you guys think? 30. I'll start. The 30? Why, Víctor? Because when you reach that amount, at least with my style of trading, you've traded so poorly, or things haven’t gone well enough that turning it around, I mean recovering, is tremendously complicated. In other words, you should never get that far, no way. But, everything depends on the system. You can have a system that gives you a very large drawdown but also when you win, you win a lot. However, systems that fluctuate so much are usually complicated and I think emotionally even more difficult. Therefore, since I trade with a lot of leverage, doing scalping, I have no choice but to work with very tight stops because I can't allow a trade to eat 10-15% of my account and reach that in two trades. Since I go with a lot of leverage, I have to work with very small stops because otherwise, four or five good trades could come, but when two or three bad ones come, you can't lift the account. With my way of trading or the way I face the market with funded or very small personal accounts, small I mean perhaps $5,000-$7,000 and trading with two contracts on Nasdaq, which is quite leveraged. If you fall there, forget it. In fact, you might not even have guarantees to recover. And what do you think, Joaquín? I think to tackle this topic, we should go to the beginning. The beginning is based on the fact that the person who enters trading, or this industry rather than trading, has to understand that everyone wants their money. That's to start with. If you enter the chart and start trading on the platform, you have the banks that will want your money, the investment funds will want your money, and the brokers will want your money. If you step outside the platform and we go out of that context, you will have people wanting to sell you courses, and even if you don't pay them, you'll generate money for them, like for example, our YouTube channels. That clear. What does this mean? When you enter here, everyone wants your money. Thousands of people are after your money. Therefore, if you get into this story, you have to understand this. Everyone is after you. It's like you want to reach the river, and you have to cross a jungle. There are lions, tigers, buffaloes, and cobras, and what you want. Before reaching the river, the first thing is you have to survive. Therefore, this is where the enormous importance of drawdown comes from. This is where it comes from. Because your survival depends on it. There's nothing else that will make you survive in this jungle. Because this is a jungle. A pure jungle. Therefore, the preservation of your money is the only thing that will get you to the river. The only thing. Thus, I consider and am of the opinion that the less drawdown you have, the better for you. But I differentiate drawdown above the capital account, your capital money, and below your capital money. I make two differentiations that we can talk about later if you want. But if we talk below your initial capital, you can never exceed 20%. If pushed, 15. At least personally, I'm in at 15. If I reach 15, it's the end. Okay, we will see what end means because it's not the same to stop at 15 and go to demo. The next question would be, when do we return? What we’ve calculated is, I’ve calculated 22.5% for mathematical reasons. Basically, in a normal system, you have a mathematical expectation of 15€ on an average 10,000€ account. It's called not automatic. In a trend-following system, you have a superior mathematical expectation of 30€ per entry, and in a scalping system, you have a lower mathematical expectation of 8€. So I calculated, at 22.5%, we need 43 more winning trades to get back to the break-even point. I said, hell, 43 has to happen. That could occur in 5 months or 6. Meaning, the more drawdown we assume, the longer the recovery time will be. And if the recovery becomes a year, then it's unfeasible. Because emotionally, being a year suffering what we call the ulcer index, which is the time spent in drawdown multiplied by the depth. Sure, a year at 20 below zero, as they say, imagine. I don't know if you've skied. I have been at 20 below zero in the Pyrenees and Switzerland, skiing. It's harsh, huh? Don't know if you guys have been at 20 below zero. I've slept at 20 below zero. Oh, man, yours is hardcore then. In Gredos. And thought why wasn't I on my sofa at home. Well, imagine 20 below zero one day, right? But 20 below zero for six months, it's tough, right? I think it's important for me to put depth and time in relation because it's not the same falling into a 15 and recovering quickly. There I might agree with Victor, because in a scalping system, it is easy to recover when it goes well. And perhaps in a trend-following system, if you are in drawdown, the market is not favorable to you. I don't know how Joaqin sees it. Then maybe it should be differentiated by system type. I don't have, for example, a linear operation. There are people who are at plus one, operate the same as if they are at minus one, or minus three, or plus seven, or plus twelve. There are people who operate linearly and it doesn't affect them and they don't change their way of operating. I operate by segments. I completely operate by segments. I mark my segments, like to give you an idea, when I initiate an account, I open a range of a first plus five and minus five. In that range, I can be, because also when you open an account, it's the most critical moment. Therefore, I can be there oscillating between plus five, minus five, but if I reach minus five, there's an alert. There’s an alert, and I have to change something because when I'm oscillating at that moment, I'm thinking of making money, but when I'm at minus five, I'm thinking of recovering it. They're different things. The attitude you have when facing, am I in the condition to make money, should I recover this to make money later? They're very different things. Therefore the operation and mental conditions are entirely different. This is why I believe that linear operation can't be done. There should be segments and changes in the operation. This is fundamental to me. I completely agree with what Joaquín says, and actually, the first thing he mentioned about the drawdown, it is indeed true that the smaller it is, the better, and indeed, in this industry, the normal thing is to lose money. Often someone comes to me, Víctor, I want to learn how much you think I can earn, what is your profitability? I say, this is my profitability and even if you were to operate, not even by copying would you do the same as me, not even by copying because you will take three stops, the fourth and the fifth you won't do because you are scared, and that's just the way it is. And it's true that the more demanding you are with your drawdown, the better because as normal as it is to lose, if you start losing and losing, the sooner you stop, the easier or not that you will recover, but if you start working to change those circumstances. If you move away too much, as mentioned, a 30, me doing scalping, it's okay, but if you get in there, forget it, you're already dead on the way long before. And above all because the attitude, as Joaquín comments more, it is not the same when you are winning as when you are losing, it's not the same. And I, when five positive trades come, I do the sixth trade, I don’t behave the same. I don't have the same confidence, not aggression, confidence upon operating when I get five stoppages. I could be winning for six months, five bad trades come and the sixth, my hand trembles to press a button. My behavior is different. So yes, you have to change. Yes, sometimes you lower leverage and start trading again well, but you have to change your way of facing the market because what you were doing at that moment does not work either because of the market or because you are not applying the system correctly. I have a system, and it’s not the system’s profitability, it's the profitability I get with it because with the system, I might spend a month thinking, I always look at my statistics when I lose money, saying, let's see what's failing here. I end up watching trades and thinking, how are you trading so poorly? You shouldn't have entered because the price didn't go in favor, it's not even that the operation met the conditions nor is it the setup. Could it be that type of operation? Because of anxiety, because of fear, or sometimes because of overconfidence, but these are those moments you have to stop and decide, let's see, and let's see how we recover. And you were asking earlier, Pablo, going back to the simulator? By all means, you actually have to be trading to make money, and when you're not making money, you lower leverage or go back to the simulator, which doesn’t mean anything at all. I think there's an interesting fact. Once speaking with a manager from the City, Smile, a manager, he said he wanted to talk with us to bring things over there. He says, your robots will go through my servers. He says when you reach a 30% drawdown, I will stop all your operations, and the relationship ends. I asked, why? He said, because in London, we sign a notarial power with the clients and by law, when it's greater than 30%, I go to jail. And I said, just like Spain, man. So, there's a consensus that 30% is like the absolute minimum. I think it would be interesting, perhaps, if the nuance from 30 to 20 is important, or do you think it depends on the operation or depends on the psychology, or how do you see it? It's personal, it's absolutely personal. And each must know their tolerance. When I talk about very low drawdowns, money is the least of it. The important thing is the state you find yourself in when you are there. Because most likely, you're going to get worse. So, what point for each person? Because there is no generic figure. It’s impossible. We could all agree, for example, more than a 30 is madness. But defining a 20, a 15, a 10, it's already a bit more personal. But, I'll tell you something. What Víctor says, for example, about going back to DEMO, I don't want to see the DEMO, not even in painting. Not even in painting because it's useless. What I propose and what I recommend and what I myself did and do is, you have to stop. That's clear, you have to stop. You will set the first level of alert, and at my first level of alert, it's a minus 5, you have to stop. I have to review exactly what has happened there. If it was the market if it was me, if it was, I don't know, whatever it was. I have to review. I have to review and correct because sure you find, logically, when you review, you find. But once you find and learn what you don't have to do, I continue in real. I continue in real because... But do you lower monetary management? The question I have for both of you is, do you lower monetary management when you're entering the pit? For example, you entered with 0.2 lots or two contracts, whatever, above, at the initial capital? And vice versa? When you've accumulated capital, do you increase? Because this would also affect your drawdown. How do you manage it? If Víctor wants to go first or Joaquín. Víctor, Víctor. As you want, I'll go. Joaquín, Joaquín. Let's see... I agree with Joaquín. I'm going to talk about a couple of topics that Joaquín and you have commented on. It's true that the simulated... that winning in simulated doesn't guarantee anything at all. And when you know how to trade... Let's see... Personally, lower leverage. What happens is... I do this with students because I think it's like this. I think it's like this, you know? See, when, for instance, I have a student who wants to start learning trading, it has to be in demo. Why? Because in real, the pressure you have doesn't allow you to learn or develop the skill since, in the end... You learn a setup, but when you're live in the market in real-time, hindsight you say, I should have entered here. But in real-time, gosh, for me, it's not like driving, but you have to catch that point. And why am I going to try doing it losing money? That I'm scared and in the end, you end up entering with eight contracts in reverse. And you're doing precisely the opposite, of what you have to learn or to develop that skill. Then, simulated. It is true that... I don't pass any student to real until they win for two months in simulated. And also, when they move to real, I tell them, or with a funded account because you're going to risk 80 euros, or with your account if you want, of 100 euros. The smallest you can afford because normality will be losing it. That's it, once someone is already real sometimes, we often discover things they weren't doing in the simulated stage. It means they have learned, they have shown to win. Not with my system. Sometimes they modify things that seem good to me because not with the system. The system is the least important. They're winning, showing that understanding the market always makes money, and they start in reality, and they are not doing the same thing anymore. But it's not that they don't do the same thing, but maybe there's an upward trend day, and maybe they start looking for shorts. And you say, why? Because you can find a long, and the market turns and hits your stop. Or they remove the stop. Things they didn’t do in simulated, they do because they are playing with money, and it affects them emotionally, and there you know what I do. Going back to the simulated to work the necessary habits to continue doing the same thing and be profitable. Be careful, and they won't almost ever make it the first time. But yes, I mean, I have students who can make eight trades a day, or I do. But I, for example, I am incapable of letting the price run. I try, and the price goes with plus 30 and comes back leveraging, or with my leverage or a euro, for me it affects me emotionally. And if that makes me three times, I end up removing the stop and end up blowing an account. Me, so what do I do? Go back to the simulated, what do I do? But close in zones. Now, that's it, if I close with five points, I can't put a stop of 15. That's it. At least by my stats. Adjust that trading plan or that system to me and then back to real again. Now, it's true that if you're operating in real and say no, now a season simulated, no, the simulated you will show again that you know how to do things, but where you have to learn to control is in real. That's it. There is a transition period, but indeed, real is the real. And you may as well be the god of simulated that it won't serve you at all in real. That's it, the first point Joaquín was commenting on. And the question you've asked me, Pablo, was... We were with whether you operate the same in monetary management. If you're in the pit, do you modify your charge? I always operate in mini. And well, I work with several funded accounts. You guys know, they are companies where you fund and have their pros and cons. So, I have several accounts. I operate with the mini. I have a week because as I operate live, well, I operate live with students, but on Twitch, I don't know why, emotionally, it's like I have to justify more, as showing more of what I do and mess up. But hey, I get over it more or less. What happened was that I lowered the leverage and operated better and won every day. Less, but less by four accounts. In the end, it's the same as when I operated with one account. It's all here because the points I make are the same points, but of course, instead of going to 40, I go to 4 dollars, but for 3 or 4 accounts. In the end, what happens? It seems silly, but from losing, losing, losing, what can you come with? Gosh, that I win every day. Why? Because losing 8 or 15 dollars in one account, I don't care, as Joaquín says, it's going to be the risk aversion that we each have that will affect us. And you take and win every day. Yes, I have earned 30, but 30 times 4 is 120. 30 times 4 is 120 dollars. A daily income stream of 120 dollars isn't bad for anyone, right? And if you're with the mini, watch out, with the mini, it's doing well, but it is true, this year I won in January, February, March, in April I lost, and in May, if I didn’t change, I wasn't going to make money. So yes, the leverage matters a lot and in the end, maybe sound like hot air or, right? Everything is in the head. Hot air sellers, hot air sellers. Hot air. When you know what you have to do and you don't do it. Air sellers, air sellers. That's it, that's it. I mean, but that's something, there you only learn by getting your... immersing yourself with your feet inside the market and hitting it. Sure. I, for example... The robots are always in demo. I have there the servers and always operate in demo. What happens is there is one more distinction. I don't think it's the same if you trade for yourself particularly as suddenly you’re operating to generate a track record, which is, I mean, if you're generating a track record for anything or such, you operate a little more nicely or care more that it's looking nice than if it's for yourself, it doesn't matter, you do your thing, you know how far you can go. I think there's an important distinction. It's very, very different, huh? Very different. Because it's your money and it's for you, and you don't have to, well, you operate with management, I'm not saying different, but you don't take as much care of the niceness of drawdown and such. If you'd like to say if you go to simulated or to demo, do you set a minimum time, or it’s an emotional topic until you’re okay or how long or if you lower lots, Joaquín? Do you set a minimum? We do it. I mean, we set minimum dates. If you touch a 22.5%, to me, the number is six months. I know it's a little bestial, but something very, very serious has happened when you've reached a 22, 23%, for small accounts, for big accounts, we go to a 15. Careful. The bigger, the less drawdown. Less drawdown. I mean, in a large account, a 15. So, for me, it's six months. I don't know if for you, it's also an interesting subject. I mean, when you hit when the red alert goes off, for us, it's like a color alert system. I liked what Joaquín said, if you want to delve into about the trams later. For me, a five is like yellow, and a 15 is intensely red, and a 20 is black. Four colors, right? Of course. When the black alert goes off, for me, it's six months. I tell you I always go by segments because I consider, I believe that the mental aspect goes by segments. It goes by segments according to where your account is. So if I reach minus five, like I said earlier, I stop, and the way, my first thought is to get back to the initial point because if not, I cannot be thinking about earning money. So, I resort, I go for very long objectives, you know too Pablo, I go for very long-term goals. So what I do is an operation with less bold entries, let's say, more conservative and lesser ratio. I lower the ratio a lot because what it touches is to recover, not earn money; it’s to recover. Then I base it like this until I return to the starting point and start again with the predefined, let's say, start. And the watermark because you're working on watermark, do you increase, for example, if you've gained a 10% account, do you leave it at the 10%, or do you count the watermark at zero, your initial capital? I mean, do you accumulate the capital and say if I fall below the 110, I consider the zero again or... Look, this is an issue that maybe I do it special or something odd. I, for instance, when I tell you that below I have those alarms below, and I have to change my operation because the condition, both mine and the operation, requires it; I also tell you that when I have a five percent cushion, I always want to be free in the market. I mean, my obsession is having a cushion that I know whatever I do is free, and to me that cushion is 5%. But when I have that cushion, just like when I have a minus five, I change; when I have a plus five, I also change. And I mean, I have the necessary resources to be a little more aggressive. Do you understand? I mean, I work with very little lotage that you know, too, if I put 0.10% shot, it is the moment to put 0.20%. Okay. And I have a cushion there. Double. You double. I double. And I maintain, let's say, a flat rate. I mean, if I enter with 0.20% of capital, I maintain a flat rate until, for example, I reach a 15% cushion. But a moment comes that I no longer put more in. It's already a flat rate forever. Each time I earn money, I don't increase lotage because have my comfort there. Do you understand? A time comes that, just like Víctor can maybe put two contracts, his comfort might be working with 3 contracts. So, even though I make more money, I won't put more in because I don’t want to leave my comfort zone. Clear. So, there are segments for everything. To be more aggressive and to reduce aggression and control and understand that you have to recover. I think this is common sense, and a linear operation should not be done. We are working, Víctor and I, in Artificial Intelligence to precisely make a segments model. I found this curious, never talked about it, and I find it curious. So, Víctor, how do you see the segments’ topic? See, as we don't all behave the same way, I put my particular case. I operate with the Mini. If it goes well, I have a little program with several Ninja accounts open at once, and for example, last year, which was going very well operationally, I’d operate the Mini, and what did I do? Another two accounts replicate. Why? Because as everything comes out almost, there are no issues. This year, as I had trading accounts or funding accounts with very big distinct conditions, I couldn’t operate an account where I could win or lose and then I move to another. Right? But for example, here now it has a little bad streak this month that things aren’t being good or because the system isn’t, the market isn’t in the necessary conditions for the system because I work with this five points and maybe because there is more volatility, and it jumps, and it jumps, then it goes in favor or because it tends to generate anxiety, and in the end, you end up joining or skip some parameter. What have I done? I’ve lost every day but... well, one day... No, the day before yesterday, I lost a little, but a little. But, well, that practically I have changed the circumstances, meaning you lose, lose, win, lose, lose, win a little, win a little, but I win every day, and as I always say, confidence is in winning. If you don't win, I don’t care; you won’t trust what you do, no way. So currently, what do I have? I've lowered the amount of accounts I have. I know it's all about the numbers, but I told myself, I'm having so much fun operating in front of you guys and enjoying it and winning that what I'm going to do is grab another account that replicates with low leverage and think of an account that could be 2,000 dollars, and I'm operating 4 dollars the point, and I do scalping going for 6 points or losing 5. How many negative operations must I come wrong to blow the account? A bunch. What I'm thinking almost is to get more accounts and keep adding them, which in the end, what I'm doing is having a bigger account and operating with lower leverage. This is a little more spread out, thanks to this system is working better at the moment. That there are moments in which with that more beautiful could come out and you say, damn, it's better to increase leverage and win. But do you know what happens? Very often, when you desire more than what you can do, you get in, you no longer do the same, and hit big bumps. So, at the moment, if it is true that depending on how it goes, how the market is, the system is, and particularly, it is reflected, you have to be playing there with the risk and what you do. Okay, that's it. Should we move over to my channel and continue over there? Do you pay something? Let's go. Come on, let's go. Okay.",

Joaquín Vega stresses the need to understand the psychological impact of losses and encourages traders to set clear percentage limits, like 15% from capital, as part of their risk management. When in severe drawdown, it's crucial to reassess the trading strategy, possibly reducing leverage or returning to a simulated demo environment to recalibrate. Vega also underscores the need for adapting trading strategies based on account performance segments, allowing both conservative and aggressive strategies where appropriate. The discussion also illustrates the risks of linear trading and advocates for variable approaches under different market conditions.",

    "analysis": {
      "translation": "The first thing I want you to understand is why I use the concept of hedging. Understand that I always work with a dual direction. When I talk to analysts about this topic, I tell them that for me, trends don't exist. I know they do, as we see them on charts; a trend is a succession of similar moves in the same direction, yes. But it doesn't make me work in one direction. My mind thinks in a constant dual direction because there's absolute certainty: the price goes up and down. I don't commit to any direction, so I don't have directional pressure. Those who work with charts feel pressured about which direction to take. Choose whichever direction you want. If I don't catch you going up, I'll catch you going down. Do you understand my way of thinking? This way of thinking, when facing a chart without a direction obsession, means I only work according to what the chart says under my objective methodology. It doesn't matter whether you go up or down, liberating me when viewing a chart. I earn equally if you go up or down. So I try in the long term and the short term, because it doesn't matter. This dual direction thinking is why I use hedges. Basically, I'm constantly trying to go with the price. I always want to be with it. I will try. If you rise and fall, remember it's fractal? Absolutely certain? Well, I want to be with you as much as possible. For all the attempts I'll make—up or down—some will catch a trend, a fractal consequence in my favor, and give me profit. I know this, but it doesn't matter whether it's up or down. Therefore, I need to try double. But I always want to be with you, as long as possible. Are bullish trends forming? I want to be. Bearish? I want to be there. Whichever you want, you decide. But I will try to catch you at the start, because it'll give me more movement. If I know the market is fractal, either up or down, we've said there are constant turns. There will be constant turns. Fine, I always want one of these because they will happen. Maybe I'll mistake the timing. Many times, I will be wrong, no doubt. No problem, it's part of the business plan. When I catch you and form a trend, whether longer or shorter, you'll give me movement. Therefore, I'll try to capture you. I forget about direction. I work with the essence of charts, the fractality, the turns, which result in trends that give me profit. When people try to get into the trend, I've been in it for a quarter of an hour. When people are entering, I'm already taking partials. But it doesn't end here. Do you know what happens? What's the problem? Trends end. Another contrary will form. But do you know what happens? When a trend forms, whether it be in whatever timeframe you prefer, and I'm trying to catch this turn, I don't know if it will continue up. When I'm doing this, trying to enter in some of these points, or lower cycle points, for example, I don't know if this will continue or do the opposite. If I got in here at the trend's origin, I don't know how far it will go. But when you turn, I want to be there. Not only do I want to be there, when you turn in this first attempt that I caught you at—if it's here, or here, or here—at the trend's origin or whichever timeframe, I must be alive to have taken some money before you turn. I must be alive for the exit. Of course, if I capture some money, the long position is already a winner. But I have no idea how far that's going to go. I don't know when it will turn. But I know the long position is winning. I don't have a clue if the price here will continue up or turn now. What does this mean? That I must keep a live position as an essential requirement. For several reasons. You might continue much further. And if you continue, I want to go. I'll have a limit to how long I can hold out. Of course, we all have exit limits. I do too. But I'll try to prolong as much as possible. Without dynamic stop nonsense. Because if you turn, I'll attempt flipping attempts. I might try here and fail. No problem. Maybe I tried here and failed. No problem. I keep earning. But when you fall and I catch you, I'll have a live one. But when I'm positioned in a sale, is it going to fall or keep rising? Do whatever you want. Why? Remember, I already have this in my portfolio. It's already mine, already earned it. And I still maintain a live position of X lot size. One or two or three. Depending on how I entered here, if I came with a heavy load, I might still have two or three. And when I position here and the price is here, I don't know what you're going to do. Because I don't care about direction obsession. I don't care about trend obsession. Feel free to take me out. I'll still keep winning with what I have alive. These losses are covered. The losses are free. Yeah, sure. Joaquin messes up a lot. Yeah, whatever. He has crappy accuracy percentages. But they’re free. So I won't quit. Until I catch it, I won't quit. Therefore, these sales are paid. So, what happens when I catch you? That's when the real hedging concept comes in. If I have three positions where I already took two positively out, or three—it could be different—or I entered with three and took out one. It mainly depends on the number of positions put at the start. If I have three alive, three live positions, which ultimately is one minimum, I want to go here with the same. And if I can, with two more. Or one more. With a few more. But minimum, minimum, minimum, I must carry what I have. Therefore, when I'm here, and now this happens—I just placed that new position here—now I'm selling. I'm going with three plus two. The price is in my favor. These positions are already covered. Want to take another? Take it out! I keep winning. Now, want to turn? Turn. What I’m losing on this rise, I'm winning with this, but with more two. I cover the three below, cover the three above, and have two to play with in partials. At a certain partial amount, bam! More two. So, I caught this rise with more two, and I caught this part with more two. I continue with three, and I continue with three. And once I've taken partials in one place and another place, where these positions are already covered below, and these positions are already covered above, I no longer know what direction it will continue. I already won on the rise and on the fall. Perfect! But now what are you going to do? If you fall, I keep winning. Because if it goes back, it will take these three. But when these three trigger, here I still take out two. And I continue holding one, in case you keep dropping lower. I said it, if you go up, I want to go with you. If you fall down, I want to go with you. And below, I’ll want to put more cover again at some point. I always want to go with you. Rise, fall, do what you want. Therefore, I want to, for example, be with oil constantly. I want to be with gold constantly, until maybe at some point I am no longer interested for whatever reason, retain the hedge, cash in profits of what’s there and forget about it, like we did yesterday. And start again. But I will start over with the same system. So since I want to be with you, it doesn’t matter if you move up or down, the moment I catch you, I will be looking for hedging. The moment I catch one, that gives me trajectory, and I can do this with the first position, constantly looking for hedging. At some point, they will close. Obviously. And start again. And start again. And start again. It doesn’t bother me how many trades it takes to catch the turn. Logically, those turns are sought through work zones, through processes, through thousands of ways you can try to find those turns. Turning zones. I’m not looking for turns without reason. I'm looking for places that might be of interest to find those turns. If there's synchrony of reasons, all the more reason. I’m not constantly looking for this anywhere. I have a map for this. This frees me completely from direction, which is one of the obsessions you all have. What’s it going to do? I don’t know; let it do whatever. The price is going up. Buy, then? No. How is buying mandatory? Either it goes up or down, I say again. You work with hedging in one asset. Seriously will be much simpler. I’m amazed at how complicated people make things. If at some point that rises and falls, heck. If you want to work with hedging, work it in the same chart, because it’s the essence of it for me. It’s not about direction obsession. If you don’t catch it now, you may catch it later. When you free yourself from directional thinking, your thought is always dual direction. The pressure you work with is absolutely different. You're not waiting on what you'll do. Whatever rises will sooner or later fall, man. Absolutely. We don’t know when, we don’t know where, but we have certain zones to try. If I have well-distributed all the attempts I make in a good business plan, it doesn’t matter. Because I have subdivided the risk so well that I don’t mind failing 3, 4, 5, 6 times. That’s why I enter with small lot size. But when I catch you with five steaks, it’s noticeable. Therefore, the loss or sequences of losses don’t affect me. The account doesn’t fall excessively. It can be maintained, falling gently. But when I catch five, it rises. That's it, it’s as simple as that. Now, is this for everyone? No. Why not? Because, as you're seeing, the first thing to keep in mind, I don’t go for a fixed ratio. I know I need to take an average when I win that's around 1-10. But I’m always going over by letting it run above 1-10. That’s why I’m not worried. When working on a fixed ratio, it’s more complex. Can you mentally support this operation? If not, you can’t do it, no matter how nice it seems. Because I can spend days and days and days and days. This month, those who’ve started with me on the account have been waiting for two weeks, watching it come, and I miss it, and miss it, and miss it, and miss it, and fail, and fail, and fail. Until the market aligns with me, which is what I’m waiting for. Align at some attempt. Then you’ll give it all at once. This is what we did yesterday, taking profits. I'm not after daily profits. I don’t want daily market winnings. I just want whatever it gives. If I must wait three weeks, I wait. Don’t worry. But I know it will give it. I’m going to catch it. Total control of losses, but it’ll give in. Whether you want to or not, it’ll give it. What you don’t know is when. I don’t need to get it right. I don’t want to be right. I want money. I don’t want to be highly accurate. I want to win big. Therefore, those who want to be accurate, enjoy your accuracy. I know what I need. A little. Now, those streaks will be very long. Watching the chart how it takes me out, managing, managing, managing, managing, managing. That’s why not everyone can do this. Let’s think it coldly. Mental stress. The person constantly thinking about accuracy feels stressed because when he sees five failures, the obsession with being right kicks in. Who has more stress? That person or I? The one obsessed with being right? Or the one who lives with failure? Who carries more pressure? When you coexist with the chart and failure, there's no stress. High accuracy is not essential for winning. When one understands this mentally, there is no stress. It doesn’t exist. Accuracy doesn’t guarantee money. Thoughts from the dark side. What can influence me on a chart? So when I face a chart, there’s no stress. What happens with this is that you need time. You need perfect management. You must do perfect risk management and perfect exit management. That’s not a problem. It's easy. It’s about dividing the positions you enter. The more trades you make, the less you risk. Easy as hell. Alright. Assume it will take time to catch yours. You need to know exactly what management to do. Lot size and exits. Then get to trading. Who has stress? What’s more, I’m looking at the chart, and it doesn’t bother me whether it rises or falls. Look at my stress level. You have to buy an uptrend. Relax. Downtrend. Relax. I'll catch you. Obsession with direction and accuracy. If you don’t know the direction, you won’t win anything. If you don’t hit the direction, you won’t gain anything. If you don’t have a 50% hit rate, you won’t gain anything. 18% hit rate. Doubling accounts. Explain that to yourself. Money can be made in many ways. Many ways. Winning a lot can earn you money. Sure. Winning a little can too. It all depends on how you approach it. What you need. Neither is better nor worse. If you achieve a 52% hit rate and reach your goal, bravo. If you need a 38% hit rate to reach your goal, bravo. But remember, bravo to me who needs 18%. The ways of working to seek a 38% hit, 50%, or 18% are absolutely different. Both in risks and benefits. All are good. And all can fail. I never recommend you start with hedging right away. Why not? Because when I do hedges, I know I can let them run. To reach the point where I am now, and can say I can let positions run a lot without it affecting me, I had to start small. I had to start with 1.3 at first. Then 1.4. Then 1.5. Then thinking I’m stuck. Damn, it’s hard to go beyond 1.5. Then beyond to 1.6. So all this stretches over time. But you have to recognize, know what your exit limits are. Because if you don’t know your exit limits, you will never let the profits run a lot. If you can’t handle a fixed 1.5 ratio well, how do you expect to chase a 1.10? It can't be. It will turn out terribly.",

      "translation": "The issue with context, I can't stop emphasizing it because you lack this concept. Many of you lack this concept. It's not the same to enter based on this pattern of a deception than this. Imagine the price comes, has done this, made a first deception, everything's great, everything's wonderful, that deception fails, and I'm working on a second deception. The price works well with the second deception and also gives me an entry. Perfect. It's not the same entry as this one. Are they correct patterns? Yes. But it's not the same to work on an evolution of a pattern as a first pattern that enters an area. They are different contexts. Damn, they're both correct patterns. One is first and one is second. Yes, yes, I know they are correct, but the context of the situation of one entry is not the same as the other. I always tell you, you have to evaluate good, regular, weak contexts. It can't be any other way, folks. It can't be any other way. It's not the same a second work in an area than a first one. No, because here you already have a deficiency; here the price already told you there’s a weakness. It's not the same. Therefore, this pattern happening here has a much better context than this operation. Well, regular or weak. You have to know how to evaluate the context of the entry we are making. This is very important. Why is it so important? Because in each context, if I know to evaluate the context, I can regulate. In a good context I will use one volume. In a regular context, I will use a smaller volume. And in a weak context, I will use even less. Every time you make or are about to make an entry where you see many doubts, evaluate those doubts between many doubts, which would be weak contexts, or a few doubts, regular contexts. Damn, that should tell you with what amount of lotage to enter. This is fundamental. I don't care whether the entries are aggressive or calm. Always evaluate the context. What does this mean? If I'm making an entry here and I go with a good context, I go with more lotage. The amount I decided to use in good contexts. What does that mean? That if this moves, as I already go with a good lotage, in my following fibs, I don't add more. As long as I don’t take a partial on my initial position, which goes with good lotage because the context is good, I’m not going to add more money here. Because I’d be overdoing it. If I use a good lotage on good context and I’m going to add even more, I’m making a mistake. I’m already there with sufficient lotage. I only want this area to manage. I don’t want it for adding when I entered with a good context and when I entered, supposedly, with my maximum lotages in an operation. Another thing is if I have, let's say, a regular context. What can be a regular context? This is. There’s an evolution and I know there's an evolution, I know there’s a previous pattern that failed. Here there's already a first sign of weakness. I have to know that. Which means my regular lotage will be smaller than if it were a good context. Perfect. I enter with that lesser lotage. Good. From that moment I also go with my following fib. Regular context. So far my tracking area helps me protect myself. In no case am I thinking of adding more volume yet. If it's a regular context, for me to add or think of adding slightly more, since I entered with a regular context and entered with less lotage than usual, I need the price to show me things. What things? At least, break important highs. Because as long as you don't break them, I already evaluated it was a regular context. Because if the price does this and moves slightly, I won’t be thinking of adding more volume. Of course not. If when I entered it was a regular context, what happens? Has it now become a good context because the price moved a little? Absolutely not. I'm not thinking of adding more either here. Here because I’m already with the complete lotage. And what I’d be doing is doubling positions. Adding more capital than my good context wants. And here, because I still don’t have anything the price tells me, I’m already fine, it’s no longer a regular context, it’s good. No. Another thing is if the price keeps moving, and does things I like, breaks highs and I see strength, now I might consider adding slightly more. Because the context has changed. That's why it’s so important. It bothers me a lot when I see people who seem to think all operations are alike. Folks, there aren't two identical operations. Because context always commands. We work the same patterns? Always, yes. But how are we working them? What happened in that place? Have you assessed the context of what's happening? And once you've entered, at least you've regulated the volume with good, regular, or weak, what's the price doing? Is it doing what you want? Because if it's doing this, for now, it’s not yet doing what I want. I'm not thinking of adding here, right? I set rules and tell it, for me to add position because I can, because I have excess, and because when you entered the market, you entered with a regular volume, can I add more? I need to see things from you. Bam! From that moment the context has changed. Then I can consider adding a bit more. Not before. Imagine now, I'll put another case, when I see many doubts in an operation, or even, you know I’m very aggressive working, imagine you have a second deception and the price goes plop! Let’s see. What context do I have? It's not that we’re working an extreme deception, but hey, are all extreme deceptions alike? Is this extreme deception the same as this one? Is it the same that the price comes with a lot of force, does nothing inside the area, goes out of the area, and here that the price has been working and that’s failed two operations in a row? Is it the same context? Is it the same pattern? But is it the same context? Of course not! Absolutely not! Because this would be my first work in area. Good context! But this would be a weak context. They have nothing to do with each other. And they are exactly the same pattern. Therefore, never interpret that it's an extreme deception and it's an extreme deception. Do I work all extreme deceptions the same? Absolutely not. This means that the moment the price leaves the area, people who do this and believe any extreme deception is the same, what that person is telling me is that everything that happened here is as if it didn't exist. All those symptoms of weakness that happened here the person doesn't take into account. Therefore, they will enter with the same lotage here as here. Huge mistake. We are ignoring something fundamental. What truly makes the difference between a good and bad trader. Differentiate contexts to differentiate entry lotages. This is crucial. No matter the patterns presented to us. No matter what happens in the area. I always say to you, I don't care if operations fail. I don't care about entering three consecutive operations in an area. I’m staggering my entry sizes because I’m staggering the contexts occurring. Here I’ll enter with more, in the second I’ll enter with less, and in the third, I’ll enter with less. Okay, you entered with less. I see here a weak context. Perfect. What percentage do I have of operations? With a weak context. X, whichever it is, I enter. I don’t care about failing the previous two, as if I failed 50. I am protected with my business plan and my context assessment. What do I care about failing seven previous ones? I don’t care, my account doesn't suffer. Perfect. I go with the weak. What does it mean? That you have to change my context. I go with very little lotage. The smallest I use because I’ve seen it’s a complicated operation. For X reason, complicated. I go with the smallest of my lotages. For me to change the context of what I’m seeing, you’re going to have to prove things to me. I’m excessive with the lotage. I’m excessive. I go with very little volume and the price starts to move. Followed fib. Am I going to be thinking of adding more here? No. But if the context hasn’t changed, what do I want to see in the price if I’m bought? Break highs. Which high is more important? This one? Or this one? Let's see, which high is more important? Let each one decide the confirmation they want to ask. Some would say, look, the moment the price surpasses the first high, that area that served me to protect until now, now not only serves to protect but to add a little more. Okay, perfect. Man, the context is beginning to change. Now yes, but when the price hadn't even surpassed a previous high, the context remained just as bad. One wants to validate their, let’s say, change of scenario, because these are still scenarios. As we are assessing a context, we can have 27,000 different types of scenarios. That’s why all operations are different and I must always act the same in good, regular, and weak contexts.",

      "translation": "Good morning, good afternoon. Hello, I’m Joaquín Vega. Friday, December 3rd. We continue working once again on SP500, this time on a short-term chart, a 15-minute chart. I’m going to show you a bit of what I'm expecting the price to do so I can go back to work. Well, right now we have these two short positions, sold, and I will set the targets in this zone, around 4,565. Let's set these two goals there because we have the option that the price makes that pattern you see there. I am waiting for it to make a short-term drop to this area of 4,560-65 points, to then head to a much more important zone, starting from 4,625. It is a broad zone, about 20-25 points, where we should see more significant declines. We will be trying to put in short positions there. Later I will show you the longer-term map, but let's say that now, in the short term, this is what I'm trying to achieve. We are also going to put long positions here. We are going to buy here. There is a range to this area, this range that I would like to capture. Let's see if we are able to do it. First, give us those shorts, then we buy and then sell. Well, the perfect movement. We're going with the two long positions. We’ve taken the shorts and already took a partial here. Well, let's remove one of the positions at this level that seems quite dangerous to me. We are going to take about 35 points, even though I think the price will come to these levels that we mentioned at the beginning. Be careful with this level, it could give us a shake below before going back up. We remove one of the positions here, we hold another, okay? Let's see what happens at this level and if not, we attack up here. All right. Well, we take profits and wait for developments. Let's see this area that smells dangerous to me. If the price reaches these levels, we execute, and if not, we would look for new executions below. All right. Well, folks, to end the video. As you can see, they indeed tricked us here. I thought it would go up to this area but from there I planned those sales. But look how they fooled us. Now, I do believe the position that was left took me out. At least, it's going to come to these levels. Here I'm going to try a long position. I'll show you the map I made this morning. This is the map. Every day I reinvent the map, because each day is different. I had planned for the price to reach that zone you saw there for it to then fall to these levels. But, as you see, the price didn’t reach it. It fell earlier. Therefore, now it's this zone we're pending, which is what I am marking here. It's this zone. Pay attention to this area and see what happens. We continue to hold the short positions, but be careful that we might have an extension below or before the extension we could have significant upward movements. As I always say, each day is different and new maps need to be made. Nothing else, you've seen a normal and ordinary intraday operation of any of my days and I hope it has helped you. Nothing more, regards, see you in the next video.",

      "translation": "I want you to see this movement, 5 minutes, I’ll make it bigger. What do you think of this movement? Tell me, how is this going up? Is it doing well? Is it doing poorly? Define it for me. Basically what’s happening here is that it’s having a hard time making this move. All this it's doing here is rubbish. But I want you to realize why it's rubbish. Because this happens many times, and your mission is to realize why it’s rubbish. Damn, Joaquín, how can it be rubbish if it’s going up? Yes, it can keep going up, but it will pull back. I don’t know when, but it will. That rise isn’t healthy. You shouldn’t see this fall as it is, damn. You don’t see this fall as it is. And look at that rise. Don’t you see the difference between a movement that has strength and one that doesn’t even though it's going up? It’s very noticeable. And it can continue to rise 100 more pips. Of course, it can do that, without a doubt. But it will pull back. Something is happening here, they’ve had to make a lot of effort to keep pushing the price up. This is basically saying that this is another level of imbalance. Something is happening here. I want you to understand what a level of imbalance means. They’re doing strange things here. They’re forcing the machinery for it to go up very little by little, but they lack strength. If we look at it in a minute, I don’t like it. I don’t like that rise. I don't like it. I don't like it. I'm out right away. I don't like it. Out. I'm out of two positions. Did you see what I just did? I repeat. Did you see what I just did? Do you do this? What I just did is an action. We’ve been talking about this for two days. Actions. I decide. If I say no, it's no. Even going in favor. This is what I've been trying to explain to you for two days. That price doesn’t condition me. I decide based on what it does. And as you see here, it’s not at a loss. It’s protection, but not at a loss. I don’t care. And now I don’t care that it keeps going up. The action means that I have to leave everything. No. But you’re not going up the way I want you to. You’re not doing as I say. And I’m the boss here, in my company I’m in charge. And since you’re not doing well, I decide. That’s it. And now whatever happens, happens, what I’m clear on is that the price will return to my entry points sooner or later. What happens if I take all three positions and put them at break-even? It will take them out, no doubt. All of them. Damn. I’d rather take 8 euros. The timing is horrible. It’s terrible. 8 and 8, 16. Look, I’ve made enough for four beers. Null operations. Actions. What you don’t do. This. You just stare at it. And at most, break-even. And you don't go up as I say. So, who’s in charge here? The chart or me? See how this prevents stress? Damn. You’re all stressed in front of the chart. This is going up badly. Point. There’s no turning back. It goes up badly. I don’t care if you go up 100 pips. You go up badly. It’s all the same to me. And if you go up 100 pips, I’ll leave you one. Go up if you want. And now if you want, fall. I don’t care. Do you get the idea? Is it simple or isn’t it simple? How did I execute? I executed with a first shot. Are you going in my favor? I’ll add two more. Can I add 8? Yes. But I don’t want to add eight. Why? Because the timings are bad. I decide how I’m entering. I decide when I’m getting in. I can add 12 if I want. But I add 3 because I can’t add more due to the timing I’m using. That’s it. It’s easy. I don’t do anything complicated. There’s nothing that’s hard to do. This isn’t a matter of manual skill or anything.",

      "translation": "Why am I talking to you when we are discussing how to make money? Because I am giving a lot of importance to what we call the time-space-reward relationship. What do you think I mean with this? Notice the example I am going to give you. Imagine you, living in Oviedo, are looking for a job, and they tell you that you need to go to Llanes to work every day and each time you'll be paid 50 euros. For the same job, starting from Oviedo, they tell you, you need to go to León every day, and you'll be paid 80 euros each day you go. Similarly, they tell you in Madrid, here we are going to pay you 140 euros. Exactly the same daily job, you have to go to Madrid every day. And in Valencia, they tell you, look, here we will pay you 200 euros. Exactly the same job but in different places. How would you evaluate which of these jobs or positions would be better for you? Do you understand where I am going with time-space-reward? To decide which is better for you, you have to make many evaluations. Therefore, here there is a completely different time-space-reward relationship. The specific worker, in this example, would have to make a very specific valuation of their personal case. Because look, I can give you some conditioning factors that you would have to evaluate, take into account, for example, gasoline, whether there are tolls or no tolls, tire wear, I don't know, whether I have to eat out or not. And then, for example, the issue of traffic jams, that is, there are a lot of conditioning factors when deciding this that are not only based on the amount of money. To come to the conclusion that one of these positions with the corresponding money they give you is correct for you is absolutely personal. That’s why we can’t say that when you invest in a trade with your 16 euros risk, we cannot say there’s one better than the other. What I do tell you is that for you, not for another, for you there is a relationship that is right. Under your characteristics, which have nothing to do with it, imagine we were here with 20 people, and they would all tell me something different. Because every situation is different, every personality is different, every person has different ways of thinking. So there isn’t one better than another because you could give one person an argument and the other could give you an argument depending on the situation of each one. This is vital because this example, exactly this example, transferred to each operation you will do, is identical. Which are the conditioning factors that affect you in that time-space relationship? There will be people who tell me, look, I prefer to go for an hour there, take my 50 euros, and to hell with it. Because we are saying here is a completely different time-space relationship and especially reward, completely different in each situation. One of the most important mistakes you make is that's where you fail because you think that by default there is a better way of profit, and it is absolutely false. Each one of those exit formulas, each one of those profit formulas, has good and bad things. What would you think if I told you, hey, if you're training me, you should tell me which of the four is better. No, I can tell you which of the four is better for me, but I don’t know you, and I don’t know the other person either. I don’t know each one’s situation. I am not inside your head, I don’t know your situation. What I do tell you is that we have to find which is good for you, and when I say the good for you, it’s that, hey, I’m going to Llanes with that time-space and those conditions of gasoline, traffic, whatever, delighted with life or to León or to Madrid or Valencia and I am capable of fulfilling it every day each time I go to that job or whether it be Valencia, Madrid, León or Llanes and the reward they will give me I go delighted. This is what we have to find, and this is one of the most difficult things for you to find. It is one of the things that will take you the longest time. Why does the error come? And I'll tell you here, most people fail. Because when I explain this to you in such a silly example like this, but in the end, it is exactly what will happen to you on the chart, if you are not in agreement with your time-space-reward and you find yourself uncomfortable, you will screw it up. It is the moment when you can skip all the rules. But not because you do not know them, but because mentally you have chosen a job that does not suit you. I can tell you, look, I make money and I go delighted with the example of Madrid, and therefore, since I go delighted every day with the example of Madrid, you all will go to Madrid. This is what people want. Hey, Joaquín, tell me which one I should go to, since you are the one with the experience in this. No, man, no. I have to make you understand this. I cannot give you the solution by definition because each of them I can tell you good things about each one and vice versa, or about León or Madrid. Each one has its good and bad things. I need us to know the good and bad things that Llanes, León, Madrid, and Valencia have and when we have evaluated the good and bad that it has, because here people beware, they tend to think about the good. I only think about the good that each of these forms has and stick with that. No, my friend, the one you choose will surely have bad things, and the chart is going to make you suffer them. So be very careful not to make a mistake here or think, no, León’s is better than Madrid's, because it will have to be seen. The typical error. I think Madrid is the best option. How do you mean I think? You think you can go there? Do you think you have contracted, taken, signed that job without knowing 100% that Madrid is yours? Are we crazy? How is that going to be? No, it’s just that I think so, but do you think so? Have you tried it? Have you done it? Have you experienced it? Have you experienced the traffic jams, the tolls, the tires? Have you experienced all this? Then how can you tell me that Madrid is yours without having done it? Don’t screw with me. This is what people do when going there. I consider this form of profit is mine. See, guys, you'll have to start somewhere, of course. You will have to start with León if you want. Very good, but you will have to experience what it produces to go to León every day. Or I realized that in León, perfectly, I might even be able to go to Madrid. Great, we try it again, but do not take it for granted now that there is one that is that. Because you all usually make mistakes. What is the only way to know which of those jobs is yours? Try them all, damn it. And that’s why this takes so much time. With the proper profit exit. Look, you have to understand something. This time space, if we transfer it to the chart, that chart can do things here in this time space. In this time space, it can do others. But here, it can do many more. It can do many more. And you have to tolerate it. Logically, for greater reward, more time space. You have to tolerate everything that happens in this time space. Both gasoline and tolls, as if there are traffic jams, you suck it up. You should have chosen a shorter job. Then don’t complain about the traffic jams. Don’t complain. It's that it takes a long time to get there. Normal. And do you want to take the same time to León as to Madrid or what? Do you expect the expenses to be the same or what? That is to say, it's common sense. I'm not saying anything strange, but people believe that there is a common way of profit for everyone. Because since the method earns... No, guys, I am offering you the same work but different conditions adapted to you. That is, there are a number of conditions. And in this time space is where you run the risk of that price altering you. If you make a mistake in the time space, what that price is going to do, because the price, in the end, does things as it pleases and for as long as it pleases. Remember that when you enter the market, you, with that price, control nothing of it. You only control time, space, reward. Period. But what that price can do in that period, you control nothing. Then what am I capable of enduring? What time space am I capable of enduring for whatever happens and lasts as long as it lasts my operation? I am calm.",
